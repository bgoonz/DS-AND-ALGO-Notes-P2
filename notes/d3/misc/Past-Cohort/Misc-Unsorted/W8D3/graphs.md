# Graphs


## What is a Graph?

A graph is any collection of nodes and edges. A tree is a specific implementation of a Graph. As opposed to a Binary Tree, a Graph may:

* lack a root node
* have cycles
* have any number edges leaving a node


## Terminology

### Node

A node is a basic unit of a data structure. Nodes contain data and may link to other nodes.

### Edge

A direct connection between nodes.

### Path

A series of nodes that can be traveled through edges

## Sibling Nodes
