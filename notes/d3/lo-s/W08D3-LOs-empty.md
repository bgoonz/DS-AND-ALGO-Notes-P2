# Graphs (W8D3) - Learning Objectives

## Graphs

1. Explain and implement a Graph.

- Compare graphs to trees.
- Explain the three implementations that we discussed: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, Nodes.

2. Traverse a graph.

- Be able to traverse a graph represented with both an Adjacency List and Nodes.
- Be able to use iteration and recursion.
- Implement both breadth-first and depth-first traversals.
