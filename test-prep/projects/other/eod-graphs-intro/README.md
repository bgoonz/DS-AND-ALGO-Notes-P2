# Graph Project

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a graph class.
This is a test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If
it's not clear what is failing, open the **test/graph-spec.js** file to figure out
what the test is expecting.


## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-graph-intro-starter
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `test/graph-spec.js`. Your job is to write code in
  **problems/graph.js** to implement the `Graph` class.
