# Graphs Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is for you to become comfortable with
implementing common data structures. This is important because questions about
data structures are incredibly likely to be interview questions for software
engineers from junior to senior levels. Moreover, understanding how different
data structures work will influence the libraries and frameworks that you choose
when writing software.

When you are done, you will be able to:

1. Explain and implement a Graph.
