pseudo code is most important step 


Don't rush into coding.... spend time clarifying the problem.
Think about pattern recognition and begin to formulate your approach.

Talk through your code the whole time... try to say we instead of I

# White-Boarding Tips


Things the interviewer will be looking for:

- Can you think algorithmically? Can you think about efficiency?
- Are you a good communicator? Are you someone I want to think through a new feature with?
- Can you code? Can you code neatly and correctly?


## Correct steps
- Clarify the problem & test I/O and edge cases
- Formulate your approach(es)
- Pseudocode best approach

## Code it
- Walk through an example input
- Determine the Big O time and space complexity

Clarification
Before you jump into coding, ask questions. Don't rush, it's a problem-solving demo, not a speed-coding test.

### What are we coding?
### Are there any constraints on the input/output?
What edge cases can we expect?
Test I/O
You should start with simple inputs and then slowly build up size or complexity of inputs. Look for patterns and things that remind you of problems you know how to solve.

If you draw a blank, use the following strategies to get started.

Make up a sample input and compute it. Do this two or three times.
Go through data structures in your head. Go through algorithms you know simultaneously. If you find one that works for this problem, run with it.
If not, find a naive solution, any solution, to get started. Then you can optimize.
Come up with a simpler version of the problem, solve it, then progressively add complexity.
Think aloud about the likely bounds on efficiency for your solution.
This is an easy way to score points.
"What's sure is I'll have to iterate through all the points, so it's at least linear time."
"The problem is trivial when the set is sorted. So it can definitely be done in nLOGn time. Let's see if we can do better than n Log n."
Pseudocode
Never skip this step! Companies expect you to be able to pseudocode because it is the English version of your approach to the problem. You need to lay out your strategy step by step, so that when you code, you have something to refer back to. It's easy to be lost in the intricacies of implementation, so you as well as the interviewer need pseudocode to refer back to when you lose track of your thoughts.

Be as detailed as possible
Spend as much time as you want, within reason
Make sure you can reason about implementation of every step
During the Problem
At this point, you should have spent at least 60% of your time. If you sprinted to coding, you most likely didn't spend enough time planning and will struggle here. If planned properly, this section should be the easiest part.

The nice thing about white boards is you and the interviewer are facing the same direction.
Convince yourself that you are solving the problem together. Say "we" instead of "I".
Don't stop until they tell you to.
Your style definitely makes an impact. Here are tips to how to handle your bearing.

Be confident; even if you don't know the answer, try to engage the problem, don't give up. If you keep telling an interviewer you don't know how to do something, they'll start to believe you.
Talk through the problem; they want to see the process going on in your head. If you don't talk, the interviewer doesn't learn how you break-down and analyze a problem. If you can write and talk at the same time, great! If not, tell the interviewer what you're about to write, write it, and explain what you wrote.
The interviewer may give you hints. They will ask questions to keep you on track. Don't be flustered or think you're failing; this is normal.
If they ask you "does this work", take a moment to think. Walk through the steps; out loud is fine. If you say yes, say it like you believe it; interviewers don't like to think people are just praying they'll get the answer right.
Listen to the interviewer. They are trying to help you. No one likes someone who doesn't listen.
Walk through an example input
Initiate this step - don't wait to be prompted.
Track all of your variables.
Draw stacks if you're using a recursive method.
Follow each iteration of your loops.
Reason through your code from input to output.
Time and space complexity
You should know how to do this - refer back to Big O reading if you need to.
Remember time is expensive and space is cheap.
If your approach is naive, attempt to optimize.
If not, ask your interviewer if they'd like you to optimize.
Strategies
Keep a mental list of general strategies you can turn to. Here are a few:

Bucketizing with a hash: If the input set is bounded, try organizing it into a hash.
Ex: Sort an array of 100,000 integers that are all in the range 1-100
Dynamic programming, or "divide and conquer": Divide into smaller and smaller but equal subproblems.
Ex: See this solution for a Google interview question.
Look for useful mathematical properties.
Sometimes you have individual values when really what you care about is their sums.
Ex: For an array of integers 1 - 100 where all elements appear once except one that appears twice, find the repeat.
Amortized analysis: it's ok to do something memory- or space-intensive if you can prove that this cost comes with a greater payoff.
Ex: Implement a queue using two stacks.
Keep a stack or a queue on the side to track values as your algorithm goes through the problem.
Keep two pointers for the same iteration.
Ex: Reverse a string in place (ie. using no more memory space than the length of the string).
Perform an operation twice.
Ex: Reverse the word order of a string, but not the letters within the words.
Sort the input.
Ex: Finding anagrams.
Approach the problem from the other end.
Ex: see this solution for a Fog Creek interview question.
Use binary numbers instead of decimal numbers.
Ex: see the famous Bad King problem.
For efficiency, use binary search instead of incrementation. Esp. good for implementing math operators.
Ex: Implement division without using "/", in less than O(n) time.
Don't be Sly
If you don't understand the problem, ask for clarification. A well-formulated question is as impressive as a good answer. If you don't know something, don't make it up. Tell the interviewer you don't know and then try your best guess. Many interviewers will really like this. Same thing when you hit a snag. Don't try to cover things up and make it look like you were on the right track. Explain to the interviewer why you think the current hypothesis actually won't work.

How to handle questions you've seen before.
What if you get a whiteboard problem you already know the solution to? Obviously the ethical thing is to tell your interviewer you've seen the problem before and you'll get points for that. Put on a sad face to show you were excited about solving a new problem.

Furthermore, you won't necessarily perform better on a question you've seen. You'll probably solve it faster, but speed is overrated. On the other hand, it's much harder to show your interviewer how you think when you're really just recalling a solution. Note that the easiest parts of a problem are also the hardest to remember. So even if you confound your interviewer, they'll be left wondering why you breezed through the hardest part of the problem while stumbling on the rest. That's a failure to demonstrate how you think, which is the real purpose of a whiteboard problem.
