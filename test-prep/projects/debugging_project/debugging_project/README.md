# DSA Debugging Project

In this project, you will see some familiar-looking problems that have solutions written for them! However, these solutions are FULL of bugs. Your workflow for this project will look a little different than on other projects, so read the instructions below carefully! Also don't worry if you're not able to make it through the entire project, and save the LeetCode problems for last (don't worry - I didn't include all the super difficult ones).

## Instructions

The code for you to debug is inside the lib/ folder (prioritize the non-LeetCode problems first). Some files will require you to uncomment the function code or examples. Your workflow should look like this:
1. Walk through the given code with your pair and see if you can determine what both  
    a) the code is doing, and  
    b) what the code is trying to do.
2. Try to make some code changes! If you get stuck, there's an example input at the bottom of all the files inside the lib/ folder that you can run to try to get a better grasp of what's going on.
3. If you're still stuck after running the example input, try running the test cases for that function to see a more descriptive error message (`npm install` and either `npm test` or `mocha --grep test_name_here`).
4. If you're still stuck after running the test cases, look at the hints folder! It will show you the original buggy code as well as where the bugs are located.

Good luck and happy bug hunting!
