# Whiteboarding Problems

Today, we will be practicing whiteboarding with your pair. One pair will act as an interviewer for one question and the other pair will be the interviewing practicing the steps of how to whiteboard. Switch problems and roles every 20 minutes.

## [`intersection` Example]

Given two data sets, find the intersection of both sets.

ex: inputs of [3, 4, 5] and [2, 4, 7] should return [4]

## [Problem Set 1] - Partner A

interviewer first

## [Problem Set 2] - Partner B

interviewee first

## `removeFromTail`

[`removeFromTail` code]

Try doing `removeFromTail` for a single linked list!
