# LOs

* Explain and implement a Binary Tree.
* Identify the three types of tree traversals: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
* Explain and implement a Binary Search Tree.



# Definitions:

## Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes and any edges between those nodes. 

Ex:  
* linked lists
* trees

## Node

A node is a basic unit of a data structure. Nodes contain data and may link to other nodes.

## Edge

A direct connection between nodes.

## Path

A series of nodes that can be traveled through edges

## Tree

A Tree is a Graph that does not contain any cycles.  In computer science, in a tree there exists a special node from which every other node is accessible; we call this special node the "root"

## Binary Tree

A Tree where each parent has at most 2 children.

## Root

The single node that all other nodes inherit from, a special node from which every other node is accessible. By definition the root will not have a parent.

## Leaf

A node that does not have any children

## Sibling Nodes

Nodes which share the same parent.

## Subtree

A subtree is a portion of a tree data structure that can be viewed as a complete tree in itself. Any node in a tree, together with all the nodes below it, comprise a subtree.
