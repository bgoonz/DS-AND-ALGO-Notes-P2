### Problem:

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]` , 

``` 
3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \

```

return its level order traversal as:

``` 
[
  [3],
  [9,20],

]
```

### Solution:

The code should be self-evident.

## [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

### Problem:

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]` , 

``` 
    3
   / \
  9  20

### Solution:

The code should be self-evident.

``` javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;

## [105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/description/)

### Problem:

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

``` 
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:

``` 
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### Solution:

Pattern of preorder traversal result: `pre(root) = root + pre(root.left) + pre(root.right)`

Pattern of inorder traversal result: `in(root) = in(root.left) + root + in(root.right)`

There are no duplicates so get the first item in preorder result, pinpoint it in inorder result. Then we know the size of left and right subtree.

Repeat the process on subtrees.

``` javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;

    }
    const val = preorder[pStart]
    const node = new TreeNode(val)
    for (let i = iStart; i < iEnd; i++) {
        if (val === inorder[i]) {
            node.left = _buildTree(preorder, inorder, pStart + 1, i - iStart + (pStart + 1), iStart, i)
            node.right = _buildTree(preorder, inorder, (i + 1) - iEnd + pEnd, pEnd, i + 1, iEnd)
            break
        }
    }
    return node
}

## [107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/description/)

### Problem:

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]` , 

``` 
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \

```

### Solution:

See [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](./102.%20Binary%20Tree%20Level%20Order%20Traversal.md).

``` javascript
/**

## [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

1. ### Problem:

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]` , 

``` 
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its minimum depth = 2.

### Solution:

Ignore `null` children.

``` javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
let minDepth = function(root) {
    if (!root) {
        return 0
    }
    if (root.left !== null && root.right !== null) {
        return Math.min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right)) + 1
    } else if (root.left !== null) {
        return minDepth(root.left) + 1
    } else {

## [114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/)

### Problem:

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

``` 
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

``` 
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

### Solution:

Return the leaf node of a flattened subtree for concatenation.

``` javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**

 */
let flatten = function(root) {
    _flatten(root)
};

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode} leaf node of a flattened subtree
 */

    if (!root) {
        return null
    }
    const leftLeaf = _flatten(root.left)
    const rightLeaf = _flatten(root.right)
    if (leftLeaf !== null) {
        leftLeaf.right = root.right
        root.right = root.left
    } else if (rightLeaf === null) {
        return root

## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

### Problem:

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

### Solution:

Map the numbers to their indices as we iterate, so that we can look them back up in O(1) time complexity.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
  const indicies = {}
  
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const num = nums[i]
    if (indicies[target - num] != null) {
      return [indicies[target - num], i]
    }
    indicies[num] = i
  }
};
```

## [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/description/)

### Problem:

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

### Solution:

Pick the middle item. If it is even, pick either one.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var sortedArrayToBST = function(nums) {
  return _sortedArrayToBST(nums, 0, nums.length)
};

function _sortedArrayToBST (nums, start, end) {
  if (start >= end) { return null }

  const mid = start + Math.floor((end - start) / 2)
  const node = new TreeNode(nums[mid])
  node.left = _sortedArrayToBST(nums, start, mid)
  node.right = _sortedArrayToBST(nums, mid + 1, end)

## [17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/)

### Problem:

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

![200px-Telephone-keypad2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Telephone-keypad2.svg/200px-Telephone-keypad2.svg.png)

**Example:**

```
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
```

**Note:**

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

### Solution:

#### ONE

JavaScript specific optimization.

`Array.prototype.push` accepts arbitrary arguments which enables tighter loops.

Also, appending string is faster than prepending.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} digits
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var letterCombinations = function(digits) {
  if (digits.length <= 0) { return [] }

  const letters = [
    ,
    ,
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    ['g', 'h', 'i'],
    ['j', 'k', 'l'],
    ['m', 'n', 'o'],
    ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
    ['t', 'u', 'v'],
    ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z'],
  ]

  let result = ['']

  for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
    const arr = letters[digits[i]]
    let newResult = []
    arr.forEach(c => newResult.push(...result.map(r => r + c)))
    result = newResult
  }

  return result
};
```

#### TWO

General recursive DFS solution.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} digits
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var letterCombinations = function(digits) {
  const letters = [,, 'abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl', 'mno', 'pqrs', 'tuv', 'wxyz']
  const result = []
  if (digits.length > 0) {
    dfs(digits, 0, '', letters, result)
  }
  return result
};

function dfs (digits, idigit, path, letters, result) {
  if (idigit >= digits.length) {
    result.push(path)
    return
  }
  const str = letters[digits[idigit]]

Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` (`int`) and a list (`List[UndirectedGraphNode]`) of its `neighbors`. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

```

**Note**: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don't need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.

### Solution:

DFS. Cache the visited node before entering the next recursion.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * function UndirectedGraphNode(label) {
 *     this.label = label;
 *     this.neighbors = [];   // Array of UndirectedGraphNode
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {UndirectedGraphNode} graph
 * @return {UndirectedGraphNode}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(graph) {
  const cache = {}
  return _clone(graph)

  function _clone (graph) {
    if (!graph) { return graph }
    const label = graph.label
    if (!cache[label]) {
      cache[label] = new UndirectedGraphNode(label)
      cache[label].neighbors = graph.neighbors.map(_clone)
    }
    return cache[label]
  }
};
```
