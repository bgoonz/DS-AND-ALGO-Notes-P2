# Binary Search Tree Project

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a binary search tree. This
is a test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If it's not
clear what is failing, open the **test/test.js** file to figure out what the
test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.

Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.

## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-binary-search-tree-starter.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
  * **lib/bst.js** to implement the `BST` class
  * **lib/leet_code_108.js** as a scratch pad to work on the LeetCode.com
    problem at https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/
  * **lib/leet_code_110.js** as a scratch pad to work on the LeetCode.com
    problem at https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/
