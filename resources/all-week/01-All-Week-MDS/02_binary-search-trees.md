Now that we have a solid grasp of **Binary Trees**, let's add another constraint
to the data structure. A Binary **Search** Tree (BST) has an additional criteria
where:

+ given any node of the tree, the values in the left subtree must all be
  strictly less than the given node's value.
+ and the values in the right subtree must all be greater than or equal to the
  given node's value

### BST Definition

We can also describe a BST using a recursive definition. A **Binary Tree** is a
**Binary Search Tree** if:

+ the left subtree contains values less than the root
+ AND the right subtree contains values greater than or equal to the root
+ AND the left subtree is a Binary Search Tree
+ AND the right subtree is a Binary Search Tree

It's worth mentioning that the empty tree (a tree with 0 nodes) is indeed a BST
(did someone say base case?).

Here are a few examples of BSTs:

Take a moment to verify that the above binary trees are BSTs. Note that image 2
has the same chain structure as a linked list. This will come into play later.

Below is an example of a binary tree that is **not** a search tree because a
left child (35) is greater than it's parent (23):

### A BST is a Sorted Data Structure

So what's the big deal with BSTs? Well, because of the properties of a BST, we
can consider the tree as having an order to the values. That means the values
are fully sorted! By looking at the three BST examples above, you are probably
not convinced of things being sorted. This is because the ordering is encoded by
an in-order traversal. Let's recall our previous `inOrderPrint` function:

```javascript
function inOrderPrint(root) {
  if (!root) return;

  inOrderPrint(root.left);
  console.log(root.val);
  inOrderPrint(root.right);
}
```

If we run `inOrderPrint` on the three BSTs, we will get the following output:

```
BST 1: 42
BST 2: 4, 5, 6
BST 3: 1, 5, 7, 10, 16, 16
```

For each tree, we printed out values in increasing order! A binary search tree
contains sorted data; this will come into play when we perform algorithms on
this data structure.

Once you create a binary search tree class `BST`, you can call `insert` to build
up the `BST` without worrying about breaking the search tree property. Here are
two different trees built with the `BST` class that you'll write.

```javascript
let tree1 = new BST();
tree1.insert(10);
tree1.insert(5);
tree1.insert(16);
tree1.insert(1);
tree1.insert(7);
tree1.insert(16);

let tree2 = new BST();
tree2.insert(1);
tree2.insert(5);
tree2.insert(7);
tree2.insert(10);
tree2.insert(16);
tree2.insert(16);
```

The insertions above will yield the following trees:

Are you cringing at `tree2`? You should be. Although we have the same values in
both trees, they display drastically different structures because of the
insertion order we used. This is why we have been referring to our `BST`
implementation as **naive**. Both of these trees are Binary Search Trees,
however not all BSTs are created equal. A worst case BST degenerates into a
linked list. The "best" BSTs are **height balanced**, we'll explore this concept
soonâ„¢.

## A special traversal case

In a binary search tree, in-order traversal retrieves the keys in **ascending
sorted order**. Please review the image that you saw before about tree traversal.

![depth-first tree traversal](images/Sorted_binary_tree_ALL.svg)

Note that the in-order sort represented by where the dotted line touches the
yellow dots results in node visiting in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.
In-order traversal _always_ visits the nodes in sequential order in a binary
search tree.
