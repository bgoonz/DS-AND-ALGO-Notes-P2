# Network Tools Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is for you to have a basic understanding of
commonly-used network analysis utilities. This lesson is relevant because
interacting with networks via different tools is essential for every software
developer on the web. When you are done, you should be able to use `traceroute`
to show routes between your computer and other computers. You should also be
able to use `Wireshark` to show inspect network traffic.
