*   Graph Traversal Notes

Let's explore our classic Depth-First, but for **graphs** this time! We'll be utilizing the `GraphNode` and `Adjacency List` implementations of the following graph:

![graph](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/graphs/images/graph.png)

Since we already discussed the differences between Depth-First and Breadth-First, we'll focus just on Depth-First here. We'll leave the Breadth-First exploration in the upcoming project.

### Graph Traversal w/ GraphNode

Let's begin by assuming we have our candidate graph implemented using our `GraphNode` class:

    class GraphNode {
        constructor(val) {
            this.val = val;
            this.neighbors = [];
        }
    }
    
    let a = new GraphNode('a');
    let b = new GraphNode('b');
    let c = new GraphNode('c');
    let d = new GraphNode('d');
    let e = new GraphNode('e');
    let f = new GraphNode('f');
    a.neighbors = [e, c, b];
    c.neighbors = [b, d];
    e.neighbors = [a];
    f.neighbors = [e];

One thing we'll have to decide on is what node to begin our traversal. Depending on the structure of the graph, there may not be a suitable starting point. Remember that a graph may not have a "root". However in our candidate, `F` is like a root. It is the only valid choice because it is the only node that may access all other nodes through some path of edges. We admit, the choice of `F` is somewhat contrived and in a practical setting you may not have a nice starting point like this. We'll cover how to overcome this obstacle soon. For now we'll take `F`.

We want to build a recursive `depthFirstRecur` function that accepts a node and performs a Depth-First traversal through the graph. Let's begin with a baseline solution, although it is not yet complete to handle all graphs:

    // broken
    function depthFirstRecur(node) {
        console.log(node.val);
    
        node.neighbors.forEach(neighbor => {
            depthFirstRecur(neighbor);
        });
    }
    
    depthFirstRecur(f);

Can you see where this code goes wrong? It will get caught in an infinite cycle `f, e, a, e, a, e, a, e, ...` ! To fix this, simply store which nodes we have visited already. Whenever we hit a node that has previously been visited, then return early. We'll use JavaScript [Sets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) to store `visited` because they allow for constant time lookup.

    // using GraphNode representation
    
    function depthFirstRecur(node, visited=new Set()) {
        // if this node has already been visited, then return early
        if (visited.has(node.val)) return;
    
        // otherwise it hasn't yet been visited,
        // so print it's val and mark it as visited.
        console.log(node.val);
        visited.add(node.val);
    
        // then explore each of its neighbors
        node.neighbors.forEach(neighbor => {
            depthFirstRecur(neighbor, visited);
        });
    }
    
    depthFirstRecur(f);

This code works well and will print the values in the order `f, e, a, c, b, d`. Note that this strategy only works if the values are guaranteed to be unique.

If you are averse to recursion (don't be), we can write an iterative version using the same principles:

    function depthFirstIter(node) {
        let visited = new Set();
        let stack = [ node ];
    
        while (stack.length) {
            let node = stack.pop();
    
            // if this node has already been visited, then skip this node
            if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;
    
            // otherwise it hasn't yet been visited,
            // so print it's val and mark it as visited.
            console.log(node.val);
            visited.add(node.val);
    
            // then add its neighbors to the stack to be explored 
            stack.push(...node.neighbors);
        }
    }
    
    depthFirstIter(f);

### Graph Traversal w/ Adjacency List

Let's now assume our candidate graph in the form of an Adjacency List:

    let graph = {
        'a': ['b', 'c', 'e'],
        'b': [],
        'c': ['b', 'd'],
        'd': [],
        'e': ['a'],
        'f': ['e']
    };

Bear in mind that the nodes are just strings now, not `GraphNode`s. Other than that, the code shares many details from our previous implementations:

    // using Adjacency List representation
    
    function depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited=new Set()) {
        if (visited.has(node)) return;
    
        console.log(node);
        visited.add(node);
    
        graph[node].forEach(neighbor => {
            depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
        });
    }
    
    depthFirstRecur('f', graph);

Cool! We print values in the order `f, e, a, b, c, d`. We'll leave the iterative version to you as an exercise for later.

Instead, let's draw our attention to a point from before: having to choose `f` as the starting point isn't dynamic enough to be impressive. Also, if we choose a poor initial node, some nodes may be unreachable. For example, choosing `a` as the starting point with a call to `depthFirstRecur('a', graph)` will only print `a, b, c, d, e`. We missed out on `f`. Bummer.

We can fix this. A big advantage of using an Adjacency List is that it contains the full graph! We can use a surrounding loop to allow our traversal to jump between disconnected regions of the graph. Refactoring our code:

    function depthFirst(graph) {
        let visited = new Set();
    
        for (let node in graph) {
            _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited);
        }
    }
    
    function _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited) {
        if (visited.has(node)) return;
    
        console.log(node);
        visited.add(node);
    
        graph[node].forEach(neighbor => {
            _depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
        });
    }
    
    depthFirst(graph);

Notice that our main function `depthFirst` is iterative and accepts the entire Adjacency List as an arg. Our helper `_depthFirstRecur` is recursive. `_depthFirstRecur` serves the same job as before, it will explore a full connected region in a graph. The main `depthFirst` method will allow us to "bridge" the gap between connection regions.

Still fuzzy? Imagine we had the following graph. Before you ask, these are not two separate graphs. This is a **single** graph that contains two connected components. Another term for a graph of this structure is a "Forest" because it contains multiple "Trees", ha:

It is easy to represent this graph using an Adjacency List. We can then pass the graph into our `depthFirst` from above:

    let graph = {
        'h': ['i', 'j'],
        'i': [],
        'j': ['k'],
        'k': [],
        'l': ['m'],
        'm': []
    }
    
    depthFirst(graph);
    // prints h, i, j, k, l, m

Here's the description for how `depthFirst` operates above. We enter `depthFirst` and the for loop begins on `h`. This means we enter our `_depthFirstRecur`, which will continue to explore the "local" region as far as possible. When this recursion ends, we would have explored the entire connected region of `h, i, j, k` (note that we add these nodes to visited as well). Our recursive call then returns to the main `depthFirst` function, where we continue the for loop. We iterate it until we hit an unvisited node (`l`) and then explore it's local region as far as possible using `_depthFirstRecur`, hitting the last node `m`.
