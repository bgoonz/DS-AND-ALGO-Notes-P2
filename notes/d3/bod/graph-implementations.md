# 7 JavaScript data structures you must know

> Data structures are a foundational part of JS programming, whether you're just starting out or you've been coding for years. Let's look at the 7 data structures you should never forget.

When solving coding problems, efficiency is paramount – from the number of coding hours to runtime, to the amount of memory devoted to a solution. Thankfully, JavaScript developers use many pre-established data structures designed to solve common needs and solve real-world problems. Mastery over data structures is a major factor in marking the difference between a fresh developer and a practiced, hireable veteran.

Maybe you’re just starting out with data structures, or maybe you’ve been coding for years and just need a refresher. Today, we will walk you through the top 7 data structures that any JS developer needs to know.

Here is what we’ll cover today

What are data structures
------------------------

Data structures, at a high level, are techniques for storing and organizing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and access. Data structures determine how data is collected, the functions we can use to access it, and the relationships between data. Data structures are used in almost all areas of computer science and programming, from operating systems to basic vanilla code to artificial intelligence.

Data structures enable us to:

*   Manage and utilize large datasets
*   Search for particular data from a database
*   Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
*   Handle multiple requests from users at once
*   Simplify and speed up data processing

Data structures are vital for efficient, real-world problem solving. After all, the way we organize data has a lot of impact on performance and useability. In fact, most top companies require a strong understanding of data structures. These skills demonstrate that you know how to manage your data effectively. Anyone looking to crack the coding interview will need to master data structures.

JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures. **Primitive data structures** and data types are native to the programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string, etc. **Non-primitive data structures** are not defined by the programming language but rather by the programmer. These include linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data structures, like queue and linked lists.

Now that you have a sense of why data structures are so important, let’s discuss the top 7 data structures that every JavaScript developer needs to know.
