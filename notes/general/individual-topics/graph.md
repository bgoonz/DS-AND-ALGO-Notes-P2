It's time to generalize our knowledge! We've explored binary trees and the fundamental algorithms that accompany them. Naturally, we implemented these algorithms assuming the contraints of a binary tree. To review, these assumptions include the lack of cycles, a maximum of two children, and a single root node. However, what if we take away these contraints? How can we modify the algorithms to operate on general graphs?

What is a Graph?
----------------

A **graph** is **any** collection of nodes and edges. In contrast to our previous trees, a graph is much more relaxed in it's structure. A graph may:

*   lack a root node
*   have cycles
*   have any number edges leaving a node

In this section, we will draw heavily from our tree algorithms. The adjustments we will make to those algorithms will be motivated by these core differences.

Below are a few examples of graphs that don't agree with our CompSci definition of a binary tree:

![graphs](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/graphs/images/graphs.png)

Here are some highlights:

*   `Graph 1` lacks a root. This means there is no single node that can access all other nodes in a path through edges. This is important because we previously referenced "entire" trees by referring to the ultimate root. We can no longer do that in a graph. If we provide just `T`, you can't access `U`. If we provide just `U`, you can't access `T`. If we provide just `V`, you can't access `T` or `U`.
*   `Graph 2` has a cycle. This means there is no longer a parent-child relationship. Choose any node in `Graph 2`, its grandchild will also be its parent. Wait - what? From now on we'll have to use less specific language such as "`X` is a neighbor of `Y`." Perhaps even more deadly, imagine we ran a "simple" Depth-First traversal on this graph. We could get trapped in an infinite loop if we are not careful.
*   `Graph 3` features nodes that have more than 2 edges. Anarchy!

Graph Implementations
---------------------

There are many ways to represent a graph programmatically. Let's take a moment to explore each and describe the tradeoffs we make when choosing among them. We will use `Graph 3` from above as our candidate. Bear in mind that our graph is directed. For example, this means that `C` can access `D`, but `D` cannot access `C`.

### GraphNode Class

This implementation is most similar to how we implemented binary trees. That is, we create a node class that maintains a value and an array of references to neighboring nodes. This easily solves the problem that a node can have any number of neighbors, no longer just a left and right.

    class GraphNode {
        constructor(val) {
            this.val = val;
            this.neighbors = [];
        }
    }
    
    let a = new GraphNode('a');
    let b = new GraphNode('b');
    let c = new GraphNode('c');
    let d = new GraphNode('d');
    let e = new GraphNode('e');
    let f = new GraphNode('f');
    a.neighbors = [b, c, e];
    c.neighbors = [b, d];
    e.neighbors = [a];
    f.neighbors = [e];

This implementation is great because it feels familiar to how we implemented trees. However, this implementation is clunky in that we have no easy way to refer to the entire graph. How can we pass this graph to a function? Recall that there is no root to act as the definite starting point.

### Adjacency Matrix

This is the often the mathematician's preferred way of representing a graph. We use a 2D array to represent edges. We'll first map each node's value to an index. This means `A -> 0`, `B -> 1`, `C -> 2`, etc.. Below is the mapping for `Graph 3`:

![adj_matrix_graph](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/graphs/images/adj_matrix_graph.png)

From here, the row index will correspond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to its destination. A value of `true` will mean that there does exist an edge from source to destination.

    let matrix = [
    /*          A       B       C       D       E       F   */
    /*A*/    [true,  true,   true,   false,  true,   false],
    /*B*/    [false, true,   false,  false,  false,  false],
    /*C*/    [false, true,   true,   true,   false,  false],
    /*D*/    [false, false,  false,  true,   false,  false],
    /*E*/    [true,  false,  false,  false,  true,   false],
    /*F*/    [false, false,  false,  false,  true,   true]
    ];

A few things to note about using an adjacency matrix:

*   when the edges have direction, `matrix[i][j]` may not be the same as `matrix[j][i]`
*   it is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself, so `matrix[x][x] === true` for any `x`

An advantage of the matrix implementation is that it allows us to refer to the entire graph by simply referring to the 2D array. A huge disadvantage of using a matrix is the space required. To represent a graph of n nodes, we must allocate n2 space for the 2D array. This is even more upsetting when there are few edges in graph. We will have to use n2 space, even though the array would be sparse with only a few `true` elements.

### Adjacency List

An adjacency list seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. We use an object where keys represent the node labels. The values associated with the keys will be an array containing all adjacent nodes:

    let graph = {
        'a': ['b', 'c', 'e'],
        'b': [],
        'c': ['b', 'd'],
        'd': [],
        'e': ['a'],
        'f': ['e']
    };

An adjacency list is easy to implement and allows us to refer to the entire graph by simply referencing the object. The space required for an adjacency list is the number of edges in the graph. Since there will be at most n2 edges in a graph of n nodes, the adjacency list will use at most the same amount of space as the matrix. You'll find adjacency lists useful when attacking problems that are not explicitly about graphs. We'll elaborate more on this soon.

Did you find this lesson helpful?
