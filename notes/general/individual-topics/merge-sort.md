We've explored a few sorting algorithms already, all of them being quite slow with a runtime of O(n2). It's time to level up and learn our first time efficent sorting algorithm! We'll explore `mergeSort` in detail soon, but let's jot down some key ideas for now. The following points are not steps to algorithm yet, rather they are ideas that will motivate how we will design this algorithm:

*   it is easy to merge elements of two sorted arrays into a single sorted array
*   we can consider an array containing only a single element as already trivially sorted
    *   we can also consider an empty array as trivially sorted

The Algorithm: "Divide and Conquer"
-----------------------------------

We're going to need a helper function that solves the first major point from above. How might we merge two sorted arrays? In other words we want a `merge` function that will behave like so:

    let arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 15];
    let arr2 = [0, 2, 3, 7, 10];
    merge(arr1, arr2); // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 10, 15]

### Merge

Merging two sorted arrays is simple. Since both arrays are sorted, we know the smallest numbers to always be at the front of the arrays. We can construct the new array by comparing the first elements of both input arrays. We remove the smaller element from it's respective array and add it to our new array. Do this until both input arrays are empty:

    function merge(array1, array2) {
        let merged = [];
    
        while (array1.length || array2.length) {
            let ele1 = array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;
            let ele2 = array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;
    
            let next;
            if (ele1 < ele2) {
                next = array1.shift();
            } else {
                next = array2.shift();
            }
    
            merged.push(next);
        }
    
        return merged;
    }

If your JavaScript is rusty, don't freak out! Here are a few cool JS patterns that we leverage above.

*   `0` is considered a falsey value, meaning it acts like `false` when used in boolean expressions. All other numbers are truthy.
*   `Infinity` is a value that is guaranteed to be greater than any other quantity
*   `shift` is an array method that removes and returns the first element

Is the code still hazy? Let's look at an annotated version:

    // commented
    function merge(array1, array2) {
        let merged = [];
    
        // keep running while either array still contains elements
        while (array1.length || array2.length) {
            // if array1 is nonempty, take its the first element as ele1
            // otherwise array1 is empty, so take Infinity as ele1
            let ele1 = array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;
            
            // do the same for array2, ele2
            let ele2 = array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;
    
            let next;
            // remove the smaller of the eles from it's array
            if (ele1 < ele2) {
                next = array1.shift();
            } else {
                next = array2.shift();
            }
    
            // and add that ele to the new array
            merged.push(next);
        }
    
        return merged;
    }

By using `Infinity` as the default ele when an array is empty, we are able to elegantly handle the scenario where one array empties before the other. We know that any actual element will be less than `Infinity` so we will continually take the other element into our merged array.

In other words, we can safely handle this edge case:

    merge([10, 13, 15, 25], []);    // => [10, 13, 15, 25]

Nice! We now have a way to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. It's worth mentioning that `merge` will have a `O(n)` runtime where `n` is the combined length of the two input arrays. This is what we meant when we said it was "easy" to merge two sorted arrays; linear time is fast! We'll find fact this useful later.

### Merge Sort Recursion

Now that we satisfied the merge idea, let's handle the second point. That is, we say an array of 1 or 0 elements is already sorted. This will be the base case of our recursion. Let's begin adding this code:

    function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
        // ....
    }

If our base case pretains to an array of a very small size, then the design of our recursive case should make progress toward hitting this base scenario. In other words, we should recursively call `mergeSort` on smaller and smaller arrays. A logical way to do this is to take the input array and split it into left and right halves.

    function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
    
        let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
        let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
        let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);
    
        let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
        let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);
        // ...
    }

Here is the part of the recursion where we do a lot of hand waving and we take things on faith. We know that `mergeSort` will take in an array and return the sorted version; we assume that it works. That means the two recursive calls will return the `sortedLeft` and `sortedRight` halves.

Okay, so we have two sorted arrays. We want to return one sorted array. So `merge` them! Using the `merge` function we designed earlier:

    function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
    
        let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
        let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
        let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);
    
        let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
        let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);
        
        return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
    }

Wow. that's it. Notice how light the implementation of `mergeSort` is. Much of the heavy lifting (the actually comparisons) is done by the `merge` helper.

`mergeSort` is a classic example of a "Divide and Conquer" algorithm. In other words, we keep breaking the array into smaller and smaller sub arrays. This is the same as saying we take the problem and break it down into smaller and smaller subproblems. We do this until the subproblems are so small that we trivially know the answer to them (an array length 0 or 1 is already sorted). Once we have those subanswers we can combine to reconstruct the larger problems that we previously divided (merge the left and right subarrays).

The process is visualized below. When elements are moved to the bottom of the picture, they are going through the `merge` step:

### Merge Sort JS Implementation

Here is the full code for your reference:

    function merge(array1, array2) {
        let merged = [];
    
        while (array1.length || array2.length) {
            let ele1 = array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;
            let ele2 = array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;
    
            let next;
            if (ele1 < ele2) {
                next = array1.shift();
            } else {
                next = array2.shift();
            }
    
            merged.push(next);
        }
    
        return merged;
    }
    
    function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
    
        let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
        let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
        let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);
    
        let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
        let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);
    
        return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
    }

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

The complexity analysis of this algorithm is easier to explain through visuals, so we **highly encourage** you to watch the lecture that accompanies this reading. In any case, here is a summary of the complexity:

### Time Complexity: O(n log(n))

*   `n` is the length of the input array
*   We must calculate how many recursive calls we make. The number of recursive calls is the number of times we must split the array to reach the base case. Since we split in half each time, the number of recursive calls is `O(log(n))`.
    *   for example, say we had an array of length `32`
    *   then the length would change as `32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1`, we have to split 5 times before reaching the base case, `log(32) = 5`
    *   in our algorithm, **log(n)** describes how many times we must halve **n** until the quantity reaches 1.
*   Besides the recursive calls, we must consider the while loop within the `merge` function, which contributes `O(n)` in isolation
*   We call `merge` in every recursive `mergeSort` call, so the total complexity is **O(n \* log(n))**

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Merge Sort is the first non-O(1) space sorting algorithm we've seen thus far.

The larger the size of our input array, the greater the number of subarrays we must create in memory. These are not free! They each take up finite space, and we will need a new subarray for each element in the original input. Therefore, Merge Sort has a linear space complexity, O(n).

### When should we use Merge Sort?

Unless we, the engineers, have access in advance to some unique, exploitable insight about our dataset, it turns out that O(n log n) time is _the best_ we can do when sorting unknown datasets.

That means that Merge Sort is fast! It's way faster than Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. However, due to its linear space complexity, we must always weigh the tradeoff between speed and memory consumption when making the choice to use Merge Sort. Consider the following:

*   If you have unlimited memory available, use it, it's fast!
*   If you have a decent amount of memory available and a medium sized dataset, run some tests first, but use it!
*   If you have very limited memory and you've got time to kill, maybe you should consider other options.
*   If you have very limited memory and no time to kill...well, you're going to have to do some data analysis to look for some exploitable feature of the data set, but that takes human time.
