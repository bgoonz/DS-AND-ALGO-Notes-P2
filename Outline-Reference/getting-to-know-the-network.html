<p>Steps to solving white-boarding questions are identical to the steps necessary to
solve real-world practical problems.</p>
<p>Companies want to see how you perform as a team member in a real team.</p>
<p>Things the interviewer will be looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you think algorithmically? Can you think about efficiency?</li>
<li>Are you a good communicator? Are you someone I want to think through a new
feature with?</li>
<li>Can you code? Can you code neatly and correctly?</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="correct-steps"></a><h2 id="correct-steps-4">Correct steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clarify the problem &amp; test I/O and edge cases</li>
<li>Formulate your approach(es)</li>
<li>Pseudocode best approach</li>
<li>Code it</li>
<li>Walk through an example input</li>
<li>Determine the Big O time and space complexity</li>
</ol>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="clarification"></a><h2 id="clarification-4">Clarification</h2>
<p>Before you jump into coding, ask questions. Don't rush, it's a problem-solving
demo, not a speed-coding test.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we coding?</li>
<li>Are there any constraints on the input/output?</li>
<li>What edge cases can we expect?</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="test-i%2Fo"></a><h2 id="test-io-4">Test I/O</h2>
<p>You should start with simple inputs and then slowly build up size or complexity
of inputs. Look for patterns and things that remind you of problems you know how
to solve.</p>
<p>If you draw a blank, use the following strategies to get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make up a sample input and compute it. Do this two or three times.</li>
<li>Go through data structures in your head. Go through algorithms you know
simultaneously. If you find one that works for this problem, run with it.</li>
<li>If not, find a naive solution, any solution, to get started. Then you can
optimize.</li>
<li>Come up with a simpler version of the problem, solve it, then progressively
add complexity.</li>
<li>Think aloud about the likely bounds on efficiency for your solution.
<ul>
<li>This is an easy way to score points.</li>
<li>&quot;What's sure is I'll have to iterate through all the points, so it's at
least linear time.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The problem is trivial when the set is sorted. So it can definitely be done
in nLOGn time. Let's see if we can do better than n Log n.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="pseudocode"></a><h2 id="pseudocode-4">Pseudocode</h2>
<p>Never skip this step! Companies expect you to be able to pseudocode because it
is the English version of your approach to the problem. You need to lay out your
strategy step by step, so that when you code, you have something to refer back
to. It's easy to be lost in the intricacies of implementation, so you as well as
the interviewer need pseudocode to refer back to when you lose track of your
thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be as detailed as possible</li>
<li>Spend as much time as you want, within reason</li>
<li>Make sure you can reason about implementation of every step</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="during-the-problem"></a><h2 id="during-the-problem-4">During the Problem</h2>
<p>At this point, you should have spent at least 60% of your time. If you sprinted
to coding, you most likely didn't spend enough time planning and will struggle
here. If planned properly, this section should be the easiest part.</p>
<ul>
<li>The nice thing about white boards is you and the interviewer are facing the
same direction.</li>
<li>Convince yourself that you are solving the problem together. Say &quot;we&quot; instead
of &quot;I&quot;.</li>
<li>Don't stop until they tell you to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your style definitely makes an impact. Here are tips to how to handle your
bearing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be confident; even if you don't know the answer, try to engage the problem,
don't give up. If you keep telling an interviewer you don't know how to do
something, they'll start to believe you.</li>
<li>Talk through the problem; they want to see the process going on in your head.
If you don't talk, the interviewer doesn't learn how you break-down and
analyze a problem. If you can write and talk at the same time, great! If not,
tell the interviewer what you're about to write, write it, and explain what
you wrote.</li>
<li>The interviewer may give you hints. They will ask questions to keep you on
track. Don't be flustered or think you're failing; this is normal.</li>
<li>If they ask you &quot;does this work&quot;, take a moment to think. Walk through the
steps; out loud is fine. If you say yes, say it like you believe it;
interviewers don't like to think people are just praying they'll get the
answer right.</li>
<li>Listen to the interviewer. They are trying to help you. No one likes someone
who doesn't listen.</li>

<p>Keep a mental list of general strategies you can turn to. Here are a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bucketizing with a hash: If the input set is bounded, try organizing it into
a hash.
<ul>
<li>Ex: Sort an array of 100,000 integers that are all in the range 1-100</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic programming, or &quot;divide and conquer&quot;: Divide into smaller and smaller
but equal subproblems.

<li>Ex: See <a href="http://www.careercup.com/question?id=19286747">this solution</a> for
a Google interview question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for useful mathematical properties.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you have individual values when really what you care about is
their sums.</li>
<li>Ex: For an array of integers 1 - 100 where all elements appear once except
one that appears twice, find the repeat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis">Amortized analysis</a>: it's
ok to do something memory- or space-intensive if you can prove that this cost
comes with a greater payoff.

</li>
<li>Keep a stack or a queue on the side to track values as your algorithm goes
through the problem.</li>
<li>Keep two pointers for the same iteration.

</li>
<li>Perform an operation twice.

<p>If you don't understand the problem, ask for clarification. A well-formulated
question is as impressive as a good answer. If you don't know something, don't
make it up. Tell the interviewer you don't know and then try your best guess.
Many interviewers will really like this. Same thing when you hit a snag. Don't
try to cover things up and make it look like you were on the right track.
Explain to the interviewer why you think the current hypothesis actually won't
work.</p>

<p>What if you get a whiteboard problem you already know the solution to? Obviously
the ethical thing is to tell your interviewer you've seen the problem before and
you'll get points for that. Put on a sad face to show you were excited about
solving a new problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you won't necessarily perform better on a question you've seen.
You'll probably solve it faster, but speed is overrated. On the other hand, it's
much harder to show your interviewer how you think when you're really just
recalling a solution. Note that the easiest parts of a problem are also the
hardest to remember. So even if you confound your interviewer, they'll be left
wondering why you breezed through the hardest part of the problem while
stumbling on the rest. That's a failure to demonstrate how you think, which is
the real purpose of a whiteboard problem.</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="binary-trees"></a><h1 id="binary-trees-4">Binary Trees</h1>
<p>Binary Trees are perhaps the most pervasive data structure in computer science.
Let's take a moment to go over the basic characteristics of a Binary Tree before
we explore algorithms that utilize this structure.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-is-a-graph%3F"></a><h3 id="what-is-a-graph-8">What is a Graph?</h3>
<p>Before we define what a <strong>Tree</strong> is, we must first understand the definition of
a <strong>Graph</strong>. A graph is a collection of <strong>nodes</strong> and any <strong>edges</strong> between
those nodes. You've likely seen depictions of graphs before, they usually exist
as circles (nodes) and arrows (edges) between those circles. Below are few
examples of graphs:</p>
<p><img src="images/graphs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For now, you can ignore the blue coloring. Notice how the graphs above vary
greatly in their structure. A graph is indeed a very broad, overarching
category. In fact, linked lists and trees are both considered subclasses of
graphs. We'll cover algorithms that operate on a general graph structure later,
but for now we want to focus on what graphs are trees and what graphs are not.
It's worth mentioning that a single node with no edges (image 1) is considered a
graph. The empty graph (a graph with 0 nodes and 0 edges, not pictured 😃) is
also still a graph. This line of thinking will help us later when we design
graph algorithms.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-is-a-tree%3F"></a><h3 id="what-is-a-tree-4">What is a Tree?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Tree</strong> is a <strong>Graph</strong> that does not contain any cycles. A cycle is is
defined as a path through edges that begins and ends at the same node. This
seems straightforward, but the definition becomes a bit muddled as
Mathematicians and Computer Scientists use the term &quot;tree&quot; in slightly different
ways. Lets break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>To a Mathematician, graphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the above image are trees.</li>
<li>To a Computer Scientist, only graphs 1 ,2, and 3 are trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, at least both camps agree that graph 5 is most certainly not a tree! This
is because of the obvious cycle that spans all three nodes. However, why is
there disagreement over graph 4? The reason is this: In computer science, we use
to the term &quot;tree&quot; to really refer to a &quot;rooted tree.&quot; A &quot;rooted tree&quot; is a
&quot;tree&quot; where there exists a special node from which every other node is
accessible; we call this special node the &quot;root&quot;.  Think of the root as ultimate
ancestor, the single node that all other nodes inherit from. Above we have
colored all roots in blue. Like you'd probably suspect, in this course we'll
subscribe to the Computer Scientist's interpretation. That is, we won't consider
graph 4 a tree because there is no such root we can label.</p>
<p>You've probably heard the term &quot;root&quot; throughout your software engineering
career: root directory, root user, etc.. All of these concepts branch† from the
humble tree data structure!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-is-a-binary-tree%3F"></a><h3 id="what-is-a-binary-tree-4">What is a Binary Tree?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Binary Tree</strong> is a <strong>Tree</strong> where nodes have <strong>at most 2 children</strong>. This
means graphs 1, 2, and 3 are all Binary Trees. There exist ternary trees (at
most 3 children) and n-ary trees (at most n children), but you'll likely
encounter binary trees in your job hunt, so we'll focus on them in this course.
Based on our final definition for a binary tree, here is some food for thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>an empty graph of 0 nodes and 0 edges is a binary tree</li>
<li>a graph of 1 node and 0 edges is a binary tree</li>
<li>a linked list is a binary tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a moment to use the definitions we explored to verify that each of the
three statements above is true. We bring up these three scenarios in particular
because they are the simplest types of Binary Trees. We want to eventually build
elegant algorithms and these simple scenarios will fuel our design.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="representing-a-binary-tree-with-node-instances"></a><h3 id="representing-a-binary-tree-with-node-instances-4">Representing a Binary Tree with Node Instances</h3>
<p>Let's explore a common way to represent binary trees using some object oriented
design. A tree is a collection of nodes, so let's implement a <code>TreeNode</code> class.
We'll use properties of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> to reference the children of a
<code>TreeNode</code>. That is, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> will reference other <code>TreeNode</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">TreeNode</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">constructor</span>(val) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.val = val;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.left = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.right = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
  }
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>Constructing a tree is a matter of creating the nodes and setting <code>left</code> and
<code>right</code> however we please. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> b = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> d = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> e = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> f = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TreeNode(<span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>);

a.left = b;
a.right = c;
b.left = d;
b.right = e;
c.right = f;
</div></code></pre>
<p>The visual representation of the tree is:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph_a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To simplify our diagrams, we'll omit the arrowheads on the edges. Moving forward
you can assume that the top node is the root and the direction of edges points
downward. In other words, node A is the Root. Node A can access node B through
<code>a.left</code>, but Node B cannot access Node A.</p>
<p>We now have a data structure we can use to explore Binary Tree algorithms!
Creating a tree in this way may be tedious and repetitive, however it allows us
to decide exactly what nodes are connected and in what direction. This is will
be useful as we account for edge cases in our design.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="basic-tree-terminology"></a><h3 id="basic-tree-terminology-4">Basic Tree Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li>tree - graph with no cycles</li>
<li>binary tree - tree where nodes have at most 2 nodes</li>
<li>root - the ultimate parent, the single node of a tree that can access every
other node through edges; by definition the root will not have a parent</li>
<li>internal node - a node that has children</li>
<li>leaf - a node that does not have any children</li>
<li>path - a series of nodes that can be traveled through edges - for example A,
B, E is a path through the above tree</li>
</ul>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="traversing-trees"></a><h2 id="traversing-trees-4">Traversing trees</h2>
<p>Unlike linked lists, arrays and other linear data structures, which are usually
traversed in linear order from front to back or back to front, trees may be
traversed in multiple ways. They may be traversed in depth-first or
breadth-first order. There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first
order: in-order, pre-order and post-order.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="breadth-first-search"></a><h3 id="breadth-first-search-4">Breadth-first search</h3>
<p>Trees can also be traversed level-by-level, where you visit every node on a
level before going to a lower level. This search is referred to as breadth-first
search (BFS), as the search tree is broadened as much as possible on each depth
before going to the next depth.</p>
<p><img src="images/File:Sorted_binary_tree_breadth-first_traversal.svg" alt=""></p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="depth-first-searches"></a><h3 id="depth-first-searches-4">Depth-first searches</h3>
<p>These searches are referred to as depth-first search (DFS), since the search
tree is deepened as much as possible on each child before going to the next
sibling.</p>
<p><img src="images/Sorted_binary_tree_ALL.svg" alt=""></p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="pre-order-traversal"></a><h4 id="pre-order-traversal-4">Pre-order traversal</h4>
<p>In the above image, the pre-order is noted by when the dotted line touches the
red dot and yields F, B, A, D, C, E, G, I, H. The algorithm is as follows and is
&quot;pre-order&quot; because you access the value of the node before recursively
descending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the data of the current node</li>
<li>Recursively visit the left sub tree</li>
<li>Recursively visit the right sub tree</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="in-order-traversal"></a><h4 id="in-order-traversal-4">In-order traversal</h4>
<p>In the above image, the in-order is noted by when the dotted line touches the
yellow dot and yields A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. The algorithm is as follows and
is &quot;in-order&quot; because you access the value of the node after descending to the
left but before descending to the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursively visit the left sub tree</li>
<li>Access the data of the current node</li>
<li>Recursively visit the right sub tree</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="post-order-traversal"></a><h4 id="post-order-traversal-4">Post-order traversal</h4>
<p>In the above image, the post-order is noted by when the dotted line touches the
green dot and yields A, C, E, D, B, H, I, G, F. The algorithm is as follows and
is &quot;post-order&quot; because you access the value of the node after descending to
both branches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursively visit the left sub tree</li>
<li>Recursively visit the right sub tree</li>
<li>Access the data of the current node</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="binary-search-trees"></a><h1 id="binary-search-trees-4">Binary Search Trees</h1>
<p>Now that we have a solid grasp of <strong>Binary Trees</strong>, let's add another constraint
to the data structure. A Binary <strong>Search</strong> Tree (BST) has an additional criteria
where:</p>
<ul>
<li>given any node of the tree, the values in the left subtree must all be
strictly less than the given node's value.</li>
<li>and the values in the right subtree must all be greater than or equal to the
given node's value</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="bst-definition"></a><h3 id="bst-definition-4">BST Definition</h3>
<p>We can also describe a BST using a recursive definition. A <strong>Binary Tree</strong> is a
<strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the left subtree contains values less than the root</li>
<li>AND the right subtree contains values greater than or equal to the root</li>
<li>AND the left subtree is a Binary Search Tree</li>
<li>AND the right subtree is a Binary Search Tree</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth mentioning that the empty tree (a tree with 0 nodes) is indeed a BST
(did someone say base case?).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of BSTs:</p>
<p><img src="images/bsts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Take a moment to verify that the above binary trees are BSTs. Note that image 2
has the same chain structure as a linked list. This will come into play later.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a binary tree that is <strong>not</strong> a search tree because a
left child (35) is greater than it's parent (23):</p>
<p><img src="images/not_bst.png" alt=""></p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="a-bst-is-a-sorted-data-structure"></a><h3 id="a-bst-is-a-sorted-data-structure-4">A BST is a Sorted Data Structure</h3>
<p>So what's the big deal with BSTs? Well, because of the properties of a BST, we
can consider the tree as having an order to the values. That means the values
are fully sorted! By looking at the three BST examples above, you are probably
not convinced of things being sorted. This is because the ordering is encoded by
an in-order traversal. Let's recall our previous <code>inOrderPrint</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">inOrderPrint</span>(<span class="hljs-params">root</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!root) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;

  inOrderPrint(root.left);
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(root.val);
  inOrderPrint(root.right);
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>If we run <code>inOrderPrint</code> on the three BSTs, we will get the following output:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>BST 1: 42
BST 2: 4, 5, 6
BST 3: 1, 5, 7, 10, 16, 16
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>For each tree, we printed out values in increasing order! A binary search tree
contains sorted data; this will come into play when we perform algorithms on
this data structure.</p>
<p>Once you create a binary search tree class <code>BST</code>, you can call <code>insert</code> to build
up the <code>BST</code> without worrying about breaking the search tree property. Here are
two different trees built with the <code>BST</code> class that you'll write.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> tree1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> BST();
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>);
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>);
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">16</span>);
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">7</span>);
tree1.insert(<span class="hljs-number">16</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> tree2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> BST();
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>);
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">7</span>);
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>);
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">16</span>);
tree2.insert(<span class="hljs-number">16</span>);
</div></code></pre>
<p>The insertions above will yield the following trees:</p>
<p><img src="images/good_bad_bst.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Are you cringing at <code>tree2</code>? You should be. Although we have the same values in
both trees, they display drastically different structures because of the
insertion order we used. This is why we have been referring to our <code>BST</code>
implementation as <strong>naive</strong>. Both of these trees are Binary Search Trees,
however not all BSTs are created equal. A worst case BST degenerates into a
linked list. The &quot;best&quot; BSTs are <strong>height balanced</strong>, we'll explore this concept
soon™.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="a-special-traversal-case"></a><h2 id="a-special-traversal-case-4">A special traversal case</h2>
<p>In a binary search tree, in-order traversal retrieves the keys in <strong>ascending
sorted order</strong>. Please review the image that you saw before about tree traversal.</p>
<p><img src="images/Sorted_binary_tree_ALL.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the in-order sort represented by where the dotted line touches the
yellow dots results in node visiting in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.
In-order traversal <u>always</u> visits the nodes in sequential order in a binary

<a for="toc-anchor" id="graphs"></a><h1 id="graphs-4">Graphs</h1>
<p>It's time to generalize our knowledge! We've explored binary trees and the
fundamental algorithms that accompany them. Naturally, we implemented these
algorithms assuming the constraints of a binary tree. To review, these
assumptions include the lack of cycles, a maximum of two children, and a single
root node. However, what if we take away these constraints? How can we modify the
algorithms to operate on general graphs?</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-is-a-graph%3F"></a><h2 id="what-is-a-graph-9">What is a Graph?</h2>
<p>A <strong>graph</strong> is <strong>any</strong> collection of nodes and edges. In contrast to our
previous trees, a graph is much more relaxed in it's structure. A graph may:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack a root node</li>
<li>have cycles</li>
<li>have any number edges leaving a node</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we will draw heavily from our tree algorithms. The adjustments
we will make to those algorithms will be motivated by these core differences.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples of graphs that don't agree with our CompSci definition
of a binary tree:</p>
<p><img src="images/graphs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Graph 1</code> lacks a root. This means there is no single node that can access all
other nodes in a path through edges. This is important because we previously
referenced &quot;entire&quot; trees by referring to the ultimate root. We can no longer
do that in a graph. If we provide just <code>T</code>, you can't access <code>U</code>. If we
provide just <code>U</code>, you can't access <code>T</code>. If we provide just <code>V</code>, you can't
access <code>T</code> or <code>U</code>.</li>
<li><code>Graph 2</code> has a cycle. This means there is no longer a parent-child
relationship. Choose any node in <code>Graph 2</code>, its grandchild will also be its
parent. Wait - what? From now on we'll have to use less specific language such
as &quot;<code>X</code> is a neighbor of <code>Y</code>.&quot;  Perhaps even more deadly, imagine we ran a
&quot;simple&quot; Depth-First traversal on this graph. We could get trapped in an
infinite loop if we are not careful.</li>
<li><code>Graph 3</code> features nodes that have more than 2 edges. Anarchy!</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="graph-implementations"></a><h2 id="graph-implementations-4">Graph Implementations</h2>
<p>There are many ways to represent a graph programmatically. Let's take a moment
to explore each and describe the tradeoffs we make when choosing among them. We
will use <code>Graph 3</code> from above as our candidate. Bear in mind that our graph is
directed. For example, this means that <code>C</code> can access <code>D</code>, but <code>D</code> cannot access
<code>C</code>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="graphnode-class"></a><h3 id="graphnode-class-4">GraphNode Class</h3>
<p>This implementation is most similar to how we implemented binary trees. That is,
we create a node class that maintains a value and an array of references to
neighboring nodes. This easily solves the problem that a node can have any
number of neighbors, no longer just a left and right.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">GraphNode</span> </span>{

a.neighbors = [b, c, e];
c.neighbors = [b, d];
e.neighbors = [a];
f.neighbors = [e];
</div></code></pre>
<p>This implementation is great because it feels familiar to how we implemented
trees. However, this implementation is clunky in that we have no easy way to
refer to the entire graph. How can we pass this graph to a function? Recall that
there is no root to act as the definite starting point.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="adjacency-matrix"></a><h3 id="adjacency-matrix-4">Adjacency Matrix</h3>
<p>This is the often the mathematician's preferred way of representing a graph. We
use a 2D array to represent edges. We'll first map each node's value to an
index. This means <code>A -&gt; 0</code>, <code>B -&gt; 1</code>, <code>C -&gt; 2</code>, etc.. Below is the mapping for
<code>Graph 3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="images/adj_matrix_graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From here, the row index will correspond to the source of an edge and the column
index will correspond to its destination. A value of <code>true</code> will mean that there
does exist an edge from source to destination.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> matrix = [

<p>A few things to note about using an adjacency matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the edges have direction, <code>matrix[i][j]</code> may not be the same as
<code>matrix[j][i]</code></li>
<li>it is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself, so <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox4" checked="true"><label for="checkbox4">=== true</label> for any <code>x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>An advantage of the matrix implementation is that it allows us to refer to the
entire graph by simply referring to the 2D array. A huge disadvantage of using a
matrix is the space required. To represent a graph of n nodes, we must allocate
n<sup>2</sup> space for the 2D array. This is even more upsetting when there are
few edges in graph. We will have to use n<sup>2</sup> space, even though the
array would be sparse with only a few <code>true</code> elements.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="adjacency-list"></a><h3 id="adjacency-list-4">Adjacency List</h3>
<p>An adjacency list seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation.
We use an object where keys represent the node labels. The values associated
with the keys will be an array containing all adjacent nodes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> graph = {
    <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>],
    <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>: [],
    <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>],
    <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>: [],
    <span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>],
    <span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>]
};
</div></code></pre>
<p>An adjacency list is easy to implement and allows us to refer to the entire
graph by simply referencing the object. The space required for an adjacency list
is the number of edges in the graph. Since there will be at most n<sup>2</sup>
edges in a graph of n nodes, the adjacency list will use at most the same amount
of space as the matrix. You'll find adjacency lists useful when attacking
problems that are not explicitly about graphs. We'll elaborate more on this
soon.</p>
<hr>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="graph-traversal"></a><h1 id="graph-traversal-4">Graph Traversal</h1>
<p>Let's explore our classic Depth-First, but for <strong>graphs</strong> this time! We'll be
utilizing the <code>GraphNode</code> and <code>Adjacency List</code> implementations of the following
graph:</p>
<p><img src="images/graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since we already discussed the differences between Depth-First and
Breadth-First, we'll focus just on Depth-First here. We'll leave the
Breadth-First exploration in the upcoming project.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="graph-traversal-w%2F-graphnode"></a><h3 id="graph-traversal-w-graphnode-4">Graph Traversal w/ GraphNode</h3>
<p>Let's begin by assuming we have our candidate graph implemented using our
<code>GraphNode</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">GraphNode</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">constructor</span>(val) {

        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.neighbors = [];
    }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> GraphNode(<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> b = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> GraphNode(<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>);

a.neighbors = [e, c, b];
c.neighbors = [b, d];
e.neighbors = [a];
f.neighbors = [e];
</div></code></pre>
<p>One thing we'll have to decide on is what node to begin our traversal. Depending
on the structure of the graph, there may not be a suitable starting point.
Remember that a graph may not have a &quot;root&quot;. However in our candidate, <code>F</code> is
like a root. It is the only valid choice because it is the only node that may
access all other nodes through some path of edges. We admit, the choice of <code>F</code>
is somewhat contrived and in a practical setting you may not have a nice
starting point like this. We'll cover how to overcome this obstacle soon. For
now we'll take <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>We want to build a recursive <code>depthFirstRecur</code> function that accepts a node and
performs a Depth-First traversal through the graph. Let's begin with a baseline
solution, although it is not yet complete to handle all graphs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-comment">// broken</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">depthFirstRecur</span>(<span class="hljs-params">node</span>) </span>{

    node.neighbors.forEach(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">neighbor</span> =&gt;</span> {
        depthFirstRecur(neighbor);
    });
}

depthFirstRecur(f);
</div></code></pre>
<p>Can you see where this code goes wrong? It will get caught in an infinite cycle
<code>f, e, a, e, a, e, a, e, ...</code> ! To fix this, simply store which nodes we have
visited already. Whenever we hit a node that has previously been visited, then
return early. We'll use JavaScript
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">Sets</a>
to store <code>visited</code> because they allow for constant time lookup.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-comment">// using GraphNode representation</span>

<p>This code works well and will print the values in the order <code>f, e, a, c, b, d</code>.
Note that this strategy only works if the values are guaranteed to be unique.</p>
<p>If you are averse to recursion (don't be), we can write an iterative version
using the same principles:</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="graph-traversal-w%2F-adjacency-list"></a><h3 id="graph-traversal-w-adjacency-list-4">Graph Traversal w/ Adjacency List</h3>
<p>Let's now assume our candidate graph in the form of an Adjacency List:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> graph = {

    <span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>]
};
</div></code></pre>
<p>Bear in mind that the nodes are just strings now, not <code>GraphNode</code>s. Other than
that, the code shares many details from our previous implementations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-comment">// using Adjacency List representation</span>

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">depthFirstRecur</span>(<span class="hljs-params">node, graph, visited=new Set(</span>)) </span>{

    });
}

depthFirstRecur(<span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>, graph);
</div></code></pre>
<p>Cool! We print values in the order <code>f, e, a, b, c, d</code>. We'll leave the iterative
version to you as an exercise for later.</p>
<p>Instead, let's draw our attention to a point from before: having to choose <code>f</code>
as the starting point isn't dynamic enough to be impressive. Also, if we choose
a poor initial node, some nodes may be unreachable. For example, choosing <code>a</code> as
the starting point with a call to <code>depthFirstRecur('a', graph)</code> will only print
<code>a, b, c, d, e</code>. We missed out on <code>f</code>. Bummer.</p>
<p>We can fix this. A big advantage of using an Adjacency List is that it contains
the full graph! We can use a surrounding loop to allow our traversal to jump
between disconnected regions of the graph. Refactoring our code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">depthFirst</span>(<span class="hljs-params">graph</span>) </span>{

        _depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
    });
}

depthFirst(graph);
</div></code></pre>
<p>Notice that our main function <code>depthFirst</code> is iterative and accepts the entire
Adjacency List as an Argo. Our helper <code>_depthFirstRecur</code> is recursive.
<code>_depthFirstRecur</code> serves the same job as before, it will explore a full
connected region in a graph. The main <code>depthFirst</code> method will allow us to
&quot;bridge&quot; the gap between connection regions.</p>
<p>Still fuzzy? Imagine we had the following graph. Before you ask, these are not
two separate graphs. This is a <strong>single</strong> graph that contains two connected
components. Another term for a graph of this structure is a &quot;Forest&quot; because it
contains multiple &quot;Trees&quot;, ha:</p>
<p><img src="images/forest.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is easy to represent this graph using an Adjacency List. We can then pass the
graph into our <code>depthFirst</code> from above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> graph = {
    <span class="hljs-string">'h'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'i'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'j'</span>],

    <span class="hljs-string">'m'</span>: []
}

depthFirst(graph);
<span class="hljs-comment">// prints h, i, j, k, l, m</span>
</div></code></pre>
<p>Here's the description for how <code>depthFirst</code> operates above. We enter
<code>depthFirst</code> and the for loop begins on <code>h</code>. This means we enter our
<code>_depthFirstRecur</code>, which will continue to explore the &quot;local&quot; region as far as
possible. When this recursion ends, we would have explored the entire connected
region of <code>h, i, j, k</code> (note that we add these nodes to visited as well). Our
recursive call then returns to the main <code>depthFirst</code> function, where we continue
the for loop. We iterate it until we hit an unvisited node (<code>l</code>) and then
explore it's local region as far as possible using <code>_depthFirstRecur</code>, hitting
the last node <code>m</code>.</p>

<p>The set of tests in <strong>test/friends-of-spec.js</strong> asks you to write a function
named <code>friendsOf</code> that finds the total set of friends a specified distance away
from a person. It will take as parameters</p>
<ol>
<li>The adjacency list (which will always be an object with keys that always have
arrays as values)</li>
<li>The name of the person whose friends you need to return</li>
<li>The distance away from the person that you'll use to collect the friends
(this value will always be greater than or equal to 1)</li>
</ol>
<p>The following table interprets the distance parameter:</p>
<table>

<p>For example, say you had the following dependency graph.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> graph = {
  <span class="hljs-string">'carrie'</span>:  [<span class="hljs-string">'humza'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'jun'</span>],

</div></code></pre>
<p>Then, the following table shows the expected results for the person <strong>jun</strong> at
different distances.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">4</td>
<td>carrie, silla, humza, yervand, farrah</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At distance 1, your traversal algorithm will find the friends of <strong>jun</strong>, carrie
and silla and return them.</p>
<p>At distance 2, your traversal algorithm will find carrie and silla, then find
their friends, humza and jun for carrie, and humza and yervand for silla. But,
jun is the person that you started with, so you don't include them in the return
value. Humza is both carrie's <u>and</u> silla's friend, but you only include that
name once.</p>
<p>At a distance 3, you find carrie and silla, then humza and yervand. Then,
looking at humza's friends, you see that humza knows carrie, farrah, hun, and
silla. Only farrah is new, so that name will end up in the return value. When
your traversal looks at yervand, it sees that silla is that person's friend, but
is not a new value and does not end up getting added again to the return value.</p>
<p>At a distance four, you find carrie and silla, then humza and yervand, then
farrah. From there, you look at farrah's friends which is just humza. You
already have that name, so it doesn't get duplicated in the return value.</p>
<p>All distances 3 and greater will return the same list because you've exhausted
all of the distinct names of people. You've captured the entire circle of
friends.</p>
<p>The order in which you return the names is not important.</p>
<p>The tests also define edge cases that you also have to handle that are not in
this explanation.</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-osi-network-model"></a><h1 id="the-osi-network-model-4">The OSI Network Model</h1>
<p>One challenge with mental models is that everyone thinks about things
differently! While we've discussed the <u>TCP/IP reference model</u> at length, we
haven't introduced any others. Let's take a look at one other very well-known
reference model for networks: the <u>OSI Model</u>.</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origin of the OSI reference model,</li>
<li>each OSI layer and its properties,</li>
<li>and how to choose between OSI &amp; TCP/IP.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="more-layers%2C-~~more~~-fewer-problems%3F"></a><h2 id="more-layers-more-fewer-problems-4">More layers, <s>more</s> fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Around the same time computer scientists in the United States were hammering out
the layers of the TCP/IP reference model, a similar discussion was happening a
world away in the United Kingdom. Researchers in the UK decided that a clear
reference model needed to be available to others worldwide, so they began
working with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Standards Organization (ISO)</a>. The ISO
published a document called <strong>The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems
Interconnection</strong> (or <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html"><strong>ISO 7498</strong></a>), including a seven layer reference
model for networking, in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The <u>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)</u> reference model differs from the TCP/IP
model by its focus on standardization. The TCP/IP model is mostly focused on
practical networking concepts and isn't tightly tied to particular protocols
(other than those for which it's named). The OSI model, however, has both
conceptual layers <strong>and</strong> suggested protocols for each. This idea was
well-intentioned: make these protocols the standard so that computer scientists
have less to think about! This standardization could help prevent <u>vendor
lock-in</u> as well, since all major vendors would (hopefully) follow the
standards.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-layers-of-the-osi-model"></a><h2 id="the-layers-of-the-osi-model-4">The layers of the OSI model</h2>
<p>Here's an overview of the seven layers of the OSI model, along with some
well-known protocols for each layer:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-models-osi.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>Let's dig into each layer, starting from the top.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="application"></a><h3 id="application-8">Application</h3>
<p>The OSI <u>Application Layer</u> includes information used by client-side software.
Data transmitted on this layer will interact directly with applications, as the
name suggests, and can be displayed to the user with limited translation.
<strong>HTTP</strong> is an example of a common Application Layer protocol.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="presentation"></a><h3 id="presentation-4">Presentation</h3>
<p>The OSI <u>Presentation Layer</u> is where data gets translated into a presentable
format. This is often called the <u>syntax layer</u> since data is converted between
machine-readable &amp; human-readable syntax here as well. As a result, the
Presentation Layer may include data compression, encryption, and character
encoding. Many image formats, including <strong>JPEG</strong> and <strong>GIF</strong>, use well-known
Presentation Layer protocols.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="session"></a><h3 id="session-4">Session</h3>
<p>The OSI <u>Session Layer</u> includes protocols responsible for authentication and
data continuity. Session Layer protocols may authorize a client with the server
or re-establish a dropped connection. An example protocol you may find on this
layer is <strong>RPC (Remote Procedure Call)</strong>, a mechanism for one device to initiate
a command on another.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="transport"></a><h3 id="transport-8">Transport</h3>
<p>Now we're on familiar turf! The OSI <u>Transport Layer</u>, like the layer of the
same name in the TCP/IP reference model, utilizes transport protocols. Processes
here are focused on data integrity and connectivity. Our old friends <strong>TCP</strong> and
<strong>UDP</strong> are the two most-used transport protocols.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="network"></a><h3 id="network-4">Network</h3>
<p>The OSI <u>Network Layer</u> mirrors TCP/IP's <u>Internet Layer</u>. This layer manages
connections between remote networks, transferring packets across intermediary
devices. The best-known protocol at the Network Layer is <strong>IP</strong>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="data-link"></a><h3 id="data-link-4">Data Link</h3>
<p>Protocols at the OSI <u>Data Link Layer</u> deal with connections directly from one
machine's network interface to another. Frames targeting different MAC addresses
are transferred here, and the Data Link Layer is primarily used by machines in
local networks. The most recognizable protocol on this layer is <strong>Ethernet</strong>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="physical"></a><h3 id="physical-4">Physical</h3>
<p>OSI's <u>Physical Layer</u> goes a little deeper than the TCP/IP reference model.
Physical Layer protocols have to do with translating from raw electrical signals
to bits &amp; bytes of data. You may recognize <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> (technically known as
<strong>802.11</strong>) and <strong>DSL</strong> as common Physical Layer protocols.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="which-model-do-i-use%3F"></a><h2 id="which-model-do-i-use-4">Which model do I use?</h2>
<p>That's a lot of layers! It can be a little overwhelming to think of networks
from the two complementary but differing perspectives of the TCP/IP and OSI
reference models. Let's discuss when we might want to use each.</p>
<p>The OSI model is <u>conceptual</u>, meaning its practical uses are limited. We can
see this when we look at protocols that cross layers. For example, HTTP
primarily works on the OSI Application Layer, but includes the ability to manage
character encoding, a Presentation Layer concern. Uh-oh! This makes OSI good for
<strong>understanding concepts</strong>, but too restrictive for <strong>building new protocols</strong>.</p>
<p>The TCP/IP reference model, on the other hand, is almost purely practical.  It
was extracted from real, functional networks used by DARPA in the 1970s. Instead
of concerns with minutiae like signal-to-data conversions, TCP/IP focuses on the
core of networking: getting data from one place to another. For this reason,
it's most often used when <strong>building new systems</strong> or <strong>analyzing real
networks</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, two popular models means most engineers will flip-flop between them!
You'll often hear both models used in the same conversation. We'll discuss some
techniques to differentiate between these two models in an upcoming lesson.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-we've-learned"></a><h2 id="what-weve-learned-32">What we've learned</h2>
<p>We've examined two ways of thinking about network design &amp; functionality: first,
the TCP/IP reference model, and now the OSI model. Next up, we'll compare these
two models in greater detail.</p>
<p>After this lesson, you should feel comfortable:</p>
<ul>
<li>describing the layers of the OSI reference model,</li>
<li>giving examples of protocols used at each layer,</li>
<li>and explaining where one model may be more applicable than the other.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="tcp%2Fip%3A-four-layers"></a><h1 id="tcpip-four-layers-4">TCP/IP: Four Layers</h1>
<p>We've investigated TCP/IP in great detail, and we've seen how broad a scope it
covers. Now let's step back and think about the whole networking process. We're
breaking the TCP/IP stack down and categorizing our protocols - are you ready?</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TCP/IP four-layer reference model,</li>
<li>separation of concerns in networking,</li>
<li>and data encapsulation.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="a-layered-approach"></a><h2 id="a-layered-approach-4">A layered approach</h2>
<p>Remember that when TCP/IP was first being crafted, researchers felt it was too
large and separated the <u>Transmission Control Protocol</u> from the <u>Internet
Protocol</u>. This separation was a boon; it made the protocols easier to implement
individually and led to the Internet we know and love today!</p>
<p>We sometimes refer to this approach as <u>separation of concerns</u>. We divide up
complex processes so that many connected concepts can work independently. This
makes it easier to consider each concept in detail on its own and means each
concept can grow at its own unique pace.</p>
<p>The developers of TCP/IP took this separation even farther in 1989 when they
published <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">RFC 1122</a>. This spec, also titled &quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts
-- Communication Layers&quot;, provided a new way of thinking about the whole TCP/IP
process. According to the RFC, we can separate the connection out into four
distinct <u>layers</u>, or separate areas of interest. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Application</u></li>
<li><u>Transport</u></li>
<li><u>Internet</u></li>
<li>and <u>Link</u></li>
</ul>
<p>We refer to this as a <u>reference model</u>: a high-level overview of a complex
topic provided by an organization that manages it. The four-layer model
presented in RFC 112 is often called the <u>TCP/IP reference model</u>, simply
<u>TCP/IP model</u>, or even the <u>Department of Defense (DoD) model</u>, referring to
the original research being done at DARPA.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="layers-of-the-tcp%2Fip-model"></a><h2 id="layers-of-the-tcpip-model-4">Layers of the TCP/IP model</h2>
<p>Here's a visual summary of the four layers of the TCP/IP reference model, along
with some well-known protocols for each layer:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-models-tcp-ip.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>Let's look at what each layer of the reference model includes.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="application"></a><h3 id="application-9">Application</h3>
<p>The <u>Application Layer</u> includes protocols related to user-facing data. Some of
the protocols that's we've discussed, like <u>HTTP</u> and <u>FTP</u>, operate in this
layer. The TCP/IP model doesn't care what type of application data is used;
<strong>whatever</strong> is transmitted from the Transport Layer is considered Application
Layer data.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="transport"></a><h3 id="transport-9">Transport</h3>
<p>The <u>Transport Layer</u> includes (you guessed it) transport protocols! We've
already discussed the two best-known: <u>TCP</u> and <u>UDP</u>. This layer focuses on
connectivity between clients and servers, and relies on the lower layers to
establish network connectivity.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="internet"></a><h3 id="internet-4">Internet</h3>
<p>The <u>Internet Layer</u> is where IP lives. Data is processed in <u>packets</u> on this
layer, and routing is primarily handled with IP addresses. The Internet layer
focuses mostly on connecting separate networks together.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="link"></a><h3 id="link-4">Link</h3>
<p>The <u>Link Layer</u> includes our lower-level communication standards. Link Layer
protocols aren't concerned with the type of data being transported, but instead
focus on getting data from one local network resource to another. We jump up to
the Internet layer when dealing with resources on other networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="fifth-layer%3F"></a><h3 id="fifth-layer-4">Fifth layer?</h3>
<p>Despite the RFC specifying four layers for the TCP/IP model, you may encounter
resources detailing a five layer model for TCP/IP instead! The &quot;fifth layer&quot;
is usually the <u>Physical</u> layer. This helps us separate electrical concepts
like transmission across wires from data-oriented concepts like MAC addresses,
but isn't an official reference model from the IETF. TCP/IP doesn't explicitly
include any physical mediums, so thinking of this as a fifth layer can be
helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="translating-layers-to-data"></a><h2 id="translating-layers-to-data-4">Translating layers to data</h2>
<p>Layers provide a mental model we can use to think about how interactions across
networks occur. It's important to remember that these are &quot;best fit&quot; models,
though: they translate loosely to our actual data. Some protocols may cross
layers, and some companies will adjust these models to fit their own internal
implementations. Ultimately, these layers provide a form of shared communication
between professionals. You can count on another engineer understanding what an
&quot;Application Layer issue&quot; means, even if your own definitions differ slightly!</p>
<p>We often refer to <u>encapsulation</u> when describing how layers map to our data.
This means higher layers are <u>encapsulated</u>, or wrapped, in lower layers. For
example, a Transport Layer <u>segment</u> includes Application Layer data in its
payload, and a Link Layer <u>frame</u> includes the whole stack! Here's an example:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-models-encapsulation.svg" style="width: 100%;
  height: auto;">
</p>
<p>As we'll see, alternative networking reference models may define layers as
beginning/ending at different points in our data. However, the general idea is
shared across models: lower layer data units include data for higher layers in
their payloads.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-we've-learned"></a><h2 id="what-weve-learned-33">What we've learned</h2>
<p>When it comes to technical concepts, it's <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">&quot;reference models all the way
down&quot;</a>! These new ways of thinking about topics we've already explored will
help you communicate the concepts more clearly, and help you navigate problems
that may be deeper than your own code.</p>
<p>You should feel confident:</p>
<ul>
<li>naming each of the four canonical TCP/IP reference model layers,</li>
<li>explaining why these layers were defined,</li>
<li>and relating these layers to the data being transferred on a network.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we study networking we are going to be investigating a very low level of
computing compared to the JavaScript programming we've been doing so far.  We
are moving closer to hardware, and so we will be exposed to some new numbers,
formatted as binary or hexadecimal.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="binary"></a><h2 id="binary-4">Binary</h2>
<p>At the lowest level, a computer just speaks two values, <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.  These are
usually represented by two different voltages inside an integrated circuit known
as a CPU (Central Processing Unit).  Everything that you do on a computer,
writing and running your JavaScript code, watching videos online, chatting or
posting on social media, or playing a video game, are at a fundamental level
just 1's and 0's being processed by an integrated circuit.</p>
<p>So, what is binary? To understand this, we need to talk about bases.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="bases"></a><h3 id="bases-4">Bases</h3>
<p>What's a base?  It turns out there's not just one number system.  The number
system human beings have used for thousands of years is <strong>base 10</strong>.  This means
we count using the Arabic digits 0 through 9.  The reason we use base 10? It
should be pretty obvious. The majority of human beings have ten fingers.  So
naturally we invented a counting system that used 10 digits.  If we ever meet
aliens from another planet that only have say, six digits, they might indeed use
<strong>base 6</strong>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the base that computers speak is <strong>base 2</strong>. This derives
directly from the fact that transistors (which is what all integrated circuits
are made of) have two voltage states.  You can use <strong>base 2</strong> to perform
mathematical calculations and because of this all computing at a fundamental
level is base 2.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="base-2"></a><h3 id="base-2-4">Base 2</h3>
<p>So what does base 2 look like? Well if base 10 contains the digits 0 through 9,
then base 2 contains the digits 0 through 1.</p>
<p>If you remember from your early math education, decimal (another word for base
10) numbers can be divided into <em>places</em>.</p>
<p>For example, given the number 42, the number breaks down into the following
<em>places</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<pre><code><code><div>(4 * 10) + (2 * 1) = 42

<p>So inside computers we often call a single digit a <strong>bit</strong>. A bit can be either
<strong>on</strong> (1) or <strong>off</strong> (0).</p>
<p>A sequence of 8 bits is known as a <strong>byte</strong>.</p>
<p>So our 42 example is a single byte since it contained 8 bits:</p>
<p><code>00101010</code></p>
<p>There are also some multiples of bytes computer science borrowed from the metric
system, although with confusing results since the metric system is Base 10,
while computing is Base 2.</p>

<p>This system worked fine until computer storage got very large.  Manufacturers of
hard drives would use Base 10, while Operating Systems would often use Base 2.
The discrepancy between something like the gigabyte in base 2 vs base 10 was
very large.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Gigabyte in base 10 = 1,000,000,000 bytes 1 Gigabyte in base 2 =
1,073,741,824 bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's 73.7 Megabytes of difference! With a Terabyte it got even worse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Terabyte in base 10 = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes 1 Terabyte in base 2 =
1,099,511,627,776 bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a whopping 99.5 Gigabytes of difference.</p>
<p>Something had to be done.  So now we have two different sets of terminology one
for Base 10 and one for Base 2.</p>

<p>Still to this day, you will hear people refer to the base 2 versions as Kilobyte
or Megabyte.  Often it's hard to determine what unit is being used when
manufacturers advertise the size of hard drives or memory. Worse, Operating
Systems often display inconsistent numbers throughout their many displays of how
big disks or files are.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="another-useful-base"></a><h2 id="another-useful-base-4">Another useful base</h2>
<p>Another useful base in computing is <strong>Base 16</strong> also known as <em>hexadecimal</em>.</p>
<p>Why is this useful? This is use because hexadecimal can provide a shorter, more
human-readable version of binary.</p>
<p>So if base 10 goes from the digits 0 through 9, what are we going to do? There
aren't 16 digits...</p>
<p>The letters A through F are here to rescue us from this. The available digits
for hexadecimal are <em>0 through F</em>, where <code>A</code> is <code>10</code> decimal and <code>F</code> is <code>15</code>
decimal.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>hexadecimal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  F
decimal:     0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>It's hard to think of letters as being numbers, but in hexadecimal it's
perfectly normal.</p>
<p>So how does this help us write binary numbers in a shorter form? It's because
there are 8 bits in a byte, which means one byte can be expressed as <em>two</em>
hexadecimal digits.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <em>places</em> for hexadecimal for the decimal number 42. There's a
sixteenth's place and a one's place in this example.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>This might seem confusing at first but just like our other base examples, this
is:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>(16 * 2) + (A * 1)
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>However, since <code>A</code> is really <code>10</code> in decimal this resolves to this in decimal.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>(16 * 2) + (10 * 1) = 42
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Using this you can see that the maximum value for a two digit hexadecimal number
is <code>FF</code>, which is <code>255</code> in decimal and <code>11111111</code> in binary.</p>
<p>This happens to be the maximum value of one byte.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>FF = 255 = 11111111 = 1 byte
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>So instead of typing out an entire string of 1s and 0s we can write bytes as a
sequence of 2 digit hexadecimal numbers. We usually separate these numbers by
spaces or some other delimiter to make it clear they are a sequence of numbers:</p>
<p>For instance this sequence of numbers in decimal:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>4 8 15 16 23 42
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>is the following in binary:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>00000100 00001000 00001111 00010000 00010111 00101010
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>But in Hexadecimal it's only this:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>04 08 0F 10 17 2A
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>I hope you can see that this is a really compact and convenient way to represent
binary numbers. The numbers are always the same length, which is good for data
storage, and they can be easily translated back to binary. It might also help
rescue you from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-martian-hexidecimal-language-2015-9">Mars</a>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-%600x%60-notation"></a><h3 id="the-0x-notation-4">The <code>0x</code> Notation</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will see hexadecimal numbers represented by prepending a <code>0x</code> to
the front of them.  So our 42 would be expressed like this:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>0x2A
</div></code></code></pre>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="in-javascript"></a><h2 id="in-javascript-4">In JavaScript</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, we can use <code>toString</code> on <code>Number</code> objects to convert different
bases to decimal. We can supply a base as an argument to <code>toString</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-built_in">Number</span>(<span class="hljs-number">42</span>).toString(<span class="hljs-number">16</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// 2a</span>

</div></code></pre>
<p>We can also use our old friend <code>parseInt</code> with an optional second argument to
convert a binary or hexadecimal string to a decimal number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-built_in">parseInt</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'101010'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// 42</span>

<p>Binary and hexadecimal are often used in computing because computers are
fundamentally base 2. As you move closer to the hardware, you encounter these
more and more often.  In networking, you will see them used for IP Addresses and
MAC Addresses.  We'll learn more about that when we look next at how IP
Networking works in the next section.</p>
<hr>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="internet-protocol"></a><h1 id="internet-protocol-4">Internet Protocol</h1>
<p>As we dive deeper into understanding how computers communicate, a common
question keeps coming up: what is &quot;the Internet&quot;, exactly? To answer this, let's
discuss the <u>Internet Protocol</u>, also known as <u>IP</u>.</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What IP is and why it matters to us,</li>
<li>different protocol versions and when to use them,</li>
<li>and how to identify IP data by its formatting.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="history-of-ip"></a><h2 id="history-of-ip-4">History of IP</h2>
<p>To understand where we are today, we need to look back to where we came from.
Picture yourself in the United States in the late 1960s. The country is nearing
the end of the &quot;space race&quot; and technology is booming. There are numerous
technical teams and physical networks created as a result of recent research,
but communication between them is limited. There's also a rise of different
proprietary standards which are hampering growth: not every team can afford a
separate terminal of each available type! How can we facilitate better
collaboration with less investment required?</p>
<p>By 1974, two researchers working for <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">DARPA</a> think they have the answer. They
propose something called the <u>Transmission Control Program</u>. It's a complex
process that defines exactly how multiple networks can communicate with each
other. This protocol stands out because it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>fault tolerant</em>: data transmitted between networks can be cached and re-sent
if it fails the first time.</li>
<li><em>end-to-end</em>: there are no single central systems that can take the whole
network down; each host can send/receive to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>These highlights are critical because DARPA is a military organization. They're
looking for technology that could theoretically withstand a nuclear attack - and
the Transmission Control Program fits the bill!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-great-divide"></a><h3 id="the-great-divide-4">The great divide</h3>
<p>It became quickly apparent that that Transmission Control Program was too dense.
The process was complicated and involved many moving parts, and other engineers
raised concerns that it should be extracted into separate parts. Soon, the
Transmission Control Program was divided into two separate sections:
<u>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</u>, which was responsible for the
fault-tolerance of joined networks, and <u>Internet Protocol (IP)</u>, which was
responsible for the end-to-end nature of joined networks.</p>
<p>The protocols we use today have been improved over time, but still carry those
names and general purposes. It's amazing to think that modern social media,
video gaming, and streaming content is all dependent on 50+ year old technology!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="so-what-is-the-internet%2C-exactly%3F"></a><h2 id="so-what-is-the-internet-exactly-4">So what is the Internet, exactly?</h2>
<p>The Internet can be loosely defined as &quot;a series of <u>internetworked</u> systems&quot;.
Here's a practical example of what we mean by that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine every building in your town has a parking garage. Each garage is owned
by a different company and uses custom entry sensors. These sensors prefer
certain vehicle types: one garage for luxury sports cars only, another that will
only allow motorcycles. You may need to park in the garage for the vehicle you
own, then walk a lot. Otherwise, you'd have to own a different vehicle for each
garage! Oh no! We'd consider this an &quot;isolated&quot; model: each garage works fine
by itself, but patrons of one garage may not park elsewhere, and none of the
garages are really meeting their full potential.</p>
<p>Now imagine the garages remove their sensors. Suddenly you can park anywhere
you'd like. Your motorcycle and your neighbor's school bus can exist
harmoniously in any garage, and you can travel from garage to garage in any
vehicle you'd like. We'd consider this an &quot;internetworked&quot; model: each garage's
patrons may travel to any other garage and while the particular entrance/exit
policies may differ, drivers can rest assured knowing they'll fit anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Internet Protocol opened the door for this internetworked model in
computing. Now a network in New York City using one vendor's computers could
seamlessly communicate with a network in London from a different vendor! This
connectivity led to the birth of the Internet, which is itself <u>a series of
interconnected networks sharing data</u>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="packet-switching"></a><h2 id="packet-switching-4">Packet-Switching</h2>
<p>IP data is transmitted in a format known as a <u>packet</u>. A packet uses a data
format we've seen before: metadata in <u>headers</u>, and a <u>body</u> with content. The
headers are used to get the packet to its destination, while the body contains
the information we'd like to transfer.</p>
<p>We refer to IP's communication style as <u>packet-switching</u>. This is when a
message is split up into separate &quot;packets&quot;, delivered to a destination, and
reassembled as appropriate. Remember that IP's primary responsibility as part of
the Internet's &quot;double threat&quot;, TCP/IP, is maintaining an <u>end-to-end</u> state.
For this reason, IP isn't concerned about whether packets are received by the
client in sequential order, and may sometimes even lose packets altogether while
in transit!</p>
<blockquote>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="a-crash-course-in-bits-%26-bytes"></a><h3 id="a-crash-course-in-bits--bytes-4">A crash course in bits &amp; bytes</h3>
<p>Most of the protocols we'll cover measure their data in <u>bits</u>. We represent a
bit as a single binary digit, either 1 or 0. Since data gets long, we have
some larger units available as well! We'll sometimes describe data sizes in
<u>bytes</u>. A byte is eight bits.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;01001&quot; is five bits, and a piece of data that's 32 bits long
could also be described as &quot;4 bytes&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ip-versions"></a><h2 id="ip-versions-4">IP Versions</h2>
<p>The Internet Protocol has evolved over time, but two versions stand out as the
most used &amp; important to us: version 4 and version 6. We often refer to these as
<u>IPvX</u>, where <u>X</u>, is the version number.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ipv4"></a><h3 id="ipv4-4">IPv4</h3>
<p>The best known version of the Internet Protocol is <u>IPv4</u>. This version was
used when TCP/IP was finalized by DARPA in 1983, and it's still the most-used
protocol version online.</p>
<p>An IPv4 packet's header consists of at least 13 <u>fields</u>, or sequences of binary
bits. These fields start with a version identifier (<code>0100</code>, or &quot;4&quot; in binary),
continue with 10 sequences that define things like the length of the header and
protocol type contained in the body, and wrap up with source and destination
addresses for the packet. IPv4 also includes an allowance for a 14th optional
header field called &quot;Options&quot; that can contain extra metadata about the packet's
content, but it's not often used. An IPv4 header without options will be 20
bytes (160 bits).</p>
<p>It's hard to visualize a header since it's essentially just a long string of 1s
and 0s. Instead of trying to cram it all into one line to study, we can split
it into specified widths and stack them. Here's a stacked diagram of the IPv4
header:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-ipv4-headers.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ipv4-addresses"></a><h3 id="ipv4-addresses-4">IPv4 Addresses</h3>
<p>IPv4 addresses are composed of 4 <u>octets</u>, or 8-bit binary numbers. We usually
represent them like this:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>192.18.1.1
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>This is the same as <code>11000000.00010010.00000001.00000001</code> in binary notation,
but that's a lot harder to read! IPv4 supports around 4 billion unique
addresses.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ipv6"></a><h3 id="ipv6-4">IPv6</h3>
<p>The &quot;4 billion unique address&quot; limit seemed almost infinite in the earliest days
of the Internet, but today it's easy to see how we might use up that few
addresses! Seeing this <u>address exhaustion</u> on the horizon, Internet researchers
began concocting a new protocol version, one that would allow more addresses, in
the mid 1990's. By 2017, the new protocol was an official standard: <u>IPv6</u>.</p>
<p>IPv6 uses a totally different packet header format than IPv4, though they share
a few fields. It only uses 8 header fields, and supports optional &quot;extension
headers&quot; that come after these 8 fields, as opposed to IPv4's large &quot;Options&quot;
block.</p>
<p>The 8 fields IPv6 uses, in order, are:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-ipv6-headers.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Version</u>
<ul>
<li><code>0110</code>, or &quot;6&quot; in binary notation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Traffic Class</u>
<ul>
<li>used to identify different types of packets, like video or phone data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Flow Label</u>
<ul>
<li>an experimental option used for adding packet sequencing into IP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Payload Length</u>
<ul>
<li>lets the reciever know how large the data in the packet will be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Next Header</u>
<ul>
<li>Usually identifies the protocol type of the packet's data, but may
indicate the first extension header (if present)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Hop Limit</u>
<ul>
<li>A means of preventing packets from being passed around routers forever,
this field will be decremented by 1 every time the packet passes through
an intermediary (like a router)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Source Address</u>
<ul>
<li>Where the packet originated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Destination Address</u>
<ul>
<li>Where the packet is heading</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These headers have a fixed length of 40 bytes (320 bits).</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ipv6-addresses"></a><h3 id="ipv6-addresses-4">IPv6 Addresses</h3>
<p>Notice that IPv6 packets have fewer headers, but are double the length of IPv4
headers! This is primarily due to IPv6 addressing, which allows <strong>dramatically</strong>
more address space than IPv4. How many more addresses?</p>
<p>IPv4 supports <strong>~4 billion (4x10<sup>9</sup>)</strong> addresses.</p>
<p>IPv6 supports <strong>~350 undecillion (3.5×10<sup>38</sup>)</strong> addresses.</p>
<p>That's a billion times a billion more addresses! It's even more addresses than
grains of sand in all the world's beaches &amp; deserts (7.5x10<sup>18</sup>,
according to <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">the University of Hawaii</a>).</p>
<p>It handles this by quadrupling the number of bits in an address. IPv4 uses 32
bits, while IPv6 uses 128 bits. Remember that these bits are binary, so adding
additional bits exponentially increases the number of permutations.</p>
<p>This new address space also required a new notation. Instead of the &quot;four dotted
decimal&quot; notation of IPv4, IPv6 uses &quot;eight colon-ed hexadecimal&quot;. Here's an
example IPv6 address:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>2600:6c5e:157f:d48c:138f:e0ba:6fa7:d859
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>The same address in binary is:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>0010011000000000:0110110001011110:0001010101111111:1101010010001100:0001001110001111:1110000010111010:0110111110100111:1101100001011001
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>It's easy to see how we added so many extra addresses! That said, IPv6 is much
more difficult to read by humans. You can read some neat rules for making IPv6
addresses easier to read on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Address_representation">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="special-addresses"></a><h3 id="special-addresses-4">Special addresses</h3>
<p>Both popular versions of the Internet Protocol include space for some special
addresses that you should quickly recognize. The main one you'll encounter is
called the <u>loopback</u> address. This is the identifier for your current machine.
You'll see it repeatedly while developing because you'll navigate your browser
there to access your own servers! You may also hear this referred to as
<u>localhost</u>.</p>
<p>In IPv4 the loopback address is <code>127.0.0.1</code>. In IPv6, the loopback is <code>::1</code>.</p>
<p>There's also an <u>&quot;all interfaces&quot;</u> address. This address is used to catch any
incoming requests regardless of intended destination. It's only used by the
local machine: you would never send a packet to the &quot;all interfaces&quot; address,
but a server that is listening on that address would see all incoming packets.</p>
<p>For IPv4, the &quot;all interfaces&quot; address is <code>0.0.0.0</code>. For IPv6, it's simply <code>::</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that the loopback and &quot;all interfaces&quot; address are not interchangeable!
This is a common misconception you may encounter in tutorials online, and might
be a trick question during a technical interview. If you're ever asked to
connect to <code>localhost</code>, make sure you use the loopback.</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="transport-protocols"></a><h1 id="transport-protocols-4">Transport Protocols</h1>
<p>Between HTTP and IP, we find an extra layer of information. We often refer to
this as the <u>transport layer</u> of communication, and protocols used in it are
referred to as <u>transport protocols</u>.</p>
<p>There are myriad of transport protocols available, but we're going to cover the
two biggest: <u>TCP</u> and <u>UDP</u>. We'll dive into:</p>
<ul>
<li>why we need transport protocols,</li>
<li>the differences between TCP and UDP,</li>
<li>and where each protocol is used today.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-exactly-are-we-transporting%3F"></a><h2 id="what-exactly-are-we-transporting-4">What exactly are we transporting?</h2>
<p>We've already briefly mentioned the <u>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</u> when
discussing the history of the <u>Internet Protocol (IP)</u>. Both TCP &amp; IP made up
the original <u>Transmission Control Program</u> developed at DARPA in the 1970s.
We've dug deep into IP now, and we have some understanding of HTTP. Why do we
need more protocols?</p>
<p>Let's provide a practical example. Think about the process of delivering a
package. Floor pickers take your package from a warehouse onto the back of a
truck, and a dispatcher sends that truck to your house. There's a place on your
porch just waiting for that package. How, then, does your package make it across
the very last leg of its journey? Whoops - we forgot the delivery person!</p>
<p>Transport protocols act as our &quot;delivery person&quot;. IP is concerned with
machine-to-machine communication, and HTTP is designed for
application-to-application communication. Transport protocols bridge the gap and
help our data cover the last mile between the network and software.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="ports"></a><h3 id="ports-4">Ports</h3>
<p>Like every other part of the internetworking process, transport protocols use
their own unique form of addressing. We call these <u>ports</u>. Ports are virtual
interfaces that allow a single device to host lots of different applications &amp;
services. By lots, we mean a whole bunch - there are 65536 separate ports
available to each transport protocol!</p>
<p>Ports are represented by numbers: <code>port 80</code>, <code>port 51234</code>, etc. If we know both
the IP address and port we'd like to connect to, we can use a special notation
where both are joined by a colon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"><div>192.168.1.1:8080
</div></code></pre>
<p>This would point to port <code>8080</code> on a network interface with an IP address of
<code>192.168.1.1</code>. We refer to an IP address &amp; port written together in this way as
a <u>socket</u>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="tcp"></a><h2 id="tcp-4">TCP</h2>
<p>The most common transport protocol used is <u>TCP</u>. TCP is a connection-oriented
protocol, meaning it establishes a connection between two sockets. This
connection acts as safeguard from other error-prone protocols underneath it,
including <u>IP</u> and <u>Ethernet</u>. Pieces of data sent via TCP (referred to as
<u>segments</u>) respect a strict order and verify when they have been received. This
means that data can't be &quot;lost&quot; across a TCP connection: if a segment is
received out of order, the receiver will ask the transmitter to re-send the
missing segment. This behavior makes TCP a <u>reliable</u> protocol.</p>
<p>We'll dive deeper into exactly how TCP verifies data &amp; forms connections in a
future lesson. For now, remember that &quot;TCP == reliability&quot;. Any time it's
critical that data arrives ordered and in full, TCP's the way to go! You'll see
TCP used as the underlying connection for HTTP, file transfers, and media
streaming. In all of these cases, missing data would result in corrupt files and
unreadable data.</p>
<p>Because of everything TCP offers us, it's a relatively &quot;heavy&quot; protocol to use.
Messages may take a bit longer to transfer than they would via other protocols,
but you can be confident that your message has been received the way you
intended it. This inherent slowness means applications using TCP may <u>buffer</u>
data, or wait until a certain amount has been received before passing it to the
user. You've probably seen this happen on your favorite video sharing sites!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="udp"></a><h2 id="udp-4">UDP</h2>
<p>The <u>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</u> arrived on the scene a few years after TCP.
Scientists working with TCP found that they sometimes didn't need all the order
and reliability that TCP provided, and they were willing to trade that for raw
speed. UDP is connection-less and provides no verification for whether data is
received. Because of this, we refer to it as an <u>unreliable</u> protocol.</p>
<p>Hold on, though! By &quot;unreliable&quot;, we certainly don't mean &quot;useless&quot;. UDP is used
in lots of familiar places: real-time video sharing, voice-over-IP phone calls,
and DNS all rely on UDP as their transport protocol of choice. These services
prioritize speed over reliability, so it makes sense that they would forego
TCP's additional lag. If some data is lost along the way, that's okay - for
example, you might just see lower-quality video for a moment.</p>
<p>Unreliable systems are valuable outside the world of transport protocols as
well! Consider the postal service: most letters are sent without any sort of
delivery confirmation or guarantee of arrival. It's up to the sender and/or
recipient to manage expectations of when a letter ought to have arrived. This is
similar to UDP. Data will be transmitted, and most will arrive, but if either
side needs more reliability than that they will have to implement it themselves.</p>

<p>Transport protocols fill a gap in our current understanding of networks. They

<p>We've covered how connected devices communicate with each other, but we're
missing a key piece: where humans fit into the equation! After all, the Internet
would be a much more boring place if we had to remember the IP address of every
website we chose to visit.</p>
<p>Let's look into the <u>Domain Name System</u>, a method of translating long numeric
identifiers into friendly, human-readable addresses. We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the Domain Name System came to be,</li>
<li>how a URL gets translated to an IP address,</li>
<li>and the different types of information stored by the system.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-is-dns%3F"></a><h2 id="what-is-dns-4">What is DNS?</h2>
<p>The <u>Domain Name System</u> (often just referred to as <u>DNS</u>) is a distributed
approach to providing easily-understood names for internetworked devices.
Practically, it's similar to a phone book: DNS allows us to look up a specific
IP address by its <u>domain</u>.</p>
<p>In the early days of computer networking, connecting to another computer was a
manual, complex process. A user would need very specific addresses to find the
networked resource they were looking for, and those addresses were difficult to
read/remember! A scientist named <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">Elizabeth Feinler</a>, working with ARPA in
the early 1970's, saw a way to help. She started out with a simple text file
listing computer names by their numeric addresses. This file grew in size as
more systems joined ARPANET, and Elizabeth expanded her operation from a text
file to a whole organization dedicated to keeping an up-to-date list of
hostnames &amp; IP addresses.</p>
<p>By the 1980's, it was clear that one organization wasn't enough to manage the
growing Internet. The Domain Name System was invented as a way to distribute the
work to numerous organizations, lightening the load and allowing much more rapid
growth. The first DNS name server was written in 1984, and the rest is history!</p>
<p>DNS is one of the most important parts of allowing the Internet to grow so
rapidly. It's perfect for quick scaling because it is both simple (relying on
specifically-formatted text files) and distributed (redundant across numerous
servers).</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="domains%3F"></a><h3 id="domains-4">Domains?</h3>
<p>We've mentioned domains before today, but without much detail. Let's dive a
little deeper into that term. A website's <u>domain</u> refers to the &quot;friendly&quot; name
for the website's <u>host</u>, or the server providing the site's content. A domain
differs from a URL in that the domain is only the server's identifier, not other
application or protocol-related data in the URL.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of an average URL. We've highlighted the domain in green and
labelled each part of the URL underneath:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-dns-domain.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>A <u>domain name</u> can be split into a few parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <u>top-level domain (TLD)</u> is the last part of the domain, appearing just
before the URL begins pointing at application routes (usually indicated with
<code>/</code>'s) or query parameters (indicated with a <code>?</code> and <code>&amp;</code>'s). The best known
TLDs are <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, and <code>.org</code>. TLDs are managed by special organizations
that have demonstrated the ability to handle the immense workload involved,
often known as <u>domain registries</u>. These registries may be government
entities (for example, <code>.gov</code> is managed by the <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">General Services Agency</a>)
or private companies that were awarded the privilege by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Address_representation">ICANN</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the left of the TLD, separated by a dot, is the <u>second-level domain</u>.
You'll often hear the TLD &amp; second-level domain lumped together as &quot;the
domain&quot;. This is the name most people associate with the website. Through
<u>domain registrars</u>, consumers can purchase second-level domains. The
registrar maintains a listing of each purchase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some websites will have additional domains to the left of the second-level
domain. These can be referred to by their formal names (<u>third-level domain</u>,
<u>fourth-level domain</u>, etc.) but are often informally referred to as
<u>subdomains</u>. The best-known subdomain is <code>www</code>, though this is less-used on
newer sites. Subdomains can usually be freely created by the consumer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="how-the-magic-happens"></a><h2 id="how-the-magic-happens-4">How The Magic Happens</h2>
<p>DNS does one thing really well: identifying connected devices by friendly names.
How exactly does this work?</p>
<p>It all goes back to the magic word: <u>domain</u>. Each individual domain is
represented by a set of <u>name servers</u>, which store information about the
domain's registered subdomains. Name servers will direct a client where they
need to go - even if that's another name server! We refer to this process of
working out which name server we need as <u>resolution</u>. Eventually, we'll reach a
name server that can tell us the specific IP address for the full domain. We
refer to this as the <u>authoritative name server</u> for our domain. It has the
final say!</p>
<p>When trying to resolve a domain name, we start from the rightmost part (the TLD)
and work our way to the left. We'll stop once we've reached an authoritative
server that can give a direct address for the domain we're seeking. Intermediate
servers should be able to point us to the most-relevant name server to continue
our search (usually, the next domain to the left). We can think of this as a
conversation between the client and the available name servers for our domain,
each one moving us closer to our goal.</p>
<p>Here's a practical example of how DNS is used to discover the authoritative name
server for the fictional URL <code>https://students.appacademy.io</code>:</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="dns-records"></a><h2 id="dns-records-4">DNS Records</h2>
<p>We can see how DNS works, but what does it actually look like? It's not much
different than it was at the very beginning! Each name server maintains a <u>zone
file</u>: a text file containing host names, IP addresses, and resource types.
Here's an example of a simple zone file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"><div><span class="hljs-variable">$TTL</span> 299
my-site.com.    IN  SOA     ns1.cloudflare.com. dns.cloudflare.com. 2032032092 10000 2400 604800 3600
my-site.com.    IN  NS      ns1.my-site.com.
my-site.com.    IN  NS      ns2.my-site.com.
my-site.com.    IN  A       104.28.31.159
my-site.com.    IN  A       104.28.30.159
my-site.com.    IN  AAAA    2606:4700:30::681c:1f9f
my-site.com.    IN  AAAA    2606:4700:30::681c:1e9f
www             IN  CNAME   my-site.com.
ns1             IN  A       104.28.31.150
ns2             IN  A       104.28.30.150
my-site.com.    IN  MX      10 mail.google.com.
</div></code></pre>
<p>Each line in a zone file includes the affected domain, type of record on that
line, and the data for that record. Let's discuss some of the most common DNS
record types in the order we see them above:</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="%60soa%60"></a><h3 id="soa-4"><code>SOA</code></h3>
<p>The <u>SOA</u> record represents the <strong>S</strong>tart <strong>O</strong>f <strong>A</strong>uthority. This record lets
us know which name server is the <u>master</u>, or primary authority, for the domain
we're querying. The SOA record is the minimum requirement in a zone file - every
name server will return this record, if nothing else!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="%60ns%60"></a><h3 id="ns-4"><code>NS</code></h3>
<p><u>NS</u> records point to name servers for the zone. Most zones will have at least
two NS records for redundancy. Remember that one of DNS's strengths is that it's
distributed. If one name server loses power or becomes disconnected, we don't
lose access to the zone.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="%60a%60-%2F-%60aaaa%60"></a><h3 id="a--aaaa-4"><code>A</code> / <code>AAAA</code></h3>
<p><u>A</u> records are the most important DNS records present. They map a resource
directly to an IP address. This is the core of what DNS is for: connecting the
domain directly to a machine. <code>A</code> records are used for IPv4 addresses, while
<code>AAAA</code> records perform the same function for IPv6.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="%60cname%60"></a><h3 id="cname-4"><code>CNAME</code></h3>
<p>The <u>CNAME</u> record acts as an alias, linking one domain to another. In our
example above, we're saying that <code>www.my-site.com</code> should point at the same
resource as <code>my-site.com</code>. Notice that the <code>www</code> doesn't have a <code>.</code> after it.
This means it's a <u>relative</u> reference, and the additional parts of the domain
for this zone (<code>my-site.com.</code>) are implied. When a domain in zone file ends in a
<code>.</code> we can treat it as an <u>absolute</u> reference with no unwritten subdomains.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="%60mx%60"></a><h3 id="mx-4"><code>MX</code></h3>
<p>DNS: It's not <strong>just</strong> for websites! <u>MX</u> records, short for <strong>M</strong>ail
E<strong>x</strong>changer, are used by e-mail clients to direct messages to the appropriate
mail servers. These records let you send messages to &quot;friend@gmail.com&quot; instead
of having to remember &quot;friend@123.45.67.89&quot;!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="metadata"></a><h3 id="metadata-8">Metadata</h3>
<p>There's one piece we've overlooked in our example zone file above: the first
line. <code>$TTL 299</code> refers to the <u>Time to Live (TTL)</u> for our records. This is a
measure of how long a record should be <u>cached</u> by a DNS name server.</p>
<p>We cache DNS queries because reading from a file can be slow! When a query comes
in for a particular domain, the name server will cache the result in memory so
that subsequent requests are much faster. However, this in-memory copy won't be
updated if the zone file changes - yikes! The TTL lets us set how often a cached
record should be discarded and read from the zone file again. This is especially
important if we are pointing at a service where the IP might change frequently,
like a local development environment or shared hosting service.</p>
<p>In our example, we've set the TTL for all records in the zone file to 299
seconds. This means that if your current web host goes offline and you have to
point your domain at a new server, the downtime won't last more than
approximately five minutes. This <strong>also</strong> means that you'll be re-checking your
zone file for that domain at least once every five minutes. If you're confident
in your hosting and aren't making infrastructure changes, longer TTLs can result
in slightly increased performance.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-we've-learned"></a><h2 id="what-weve-learned-36">What we've learned</h2>
<p>The Domain Name System is a great example of a simple process (linking names to
locations) evolving over time to support greater and greater needs. It's
frightening to think of how difficult navigating around the Internet would be if
we didn't have DNS to make websites easily accessible!</p>
<p>Before we move on, here's a quick tip: <strong>DNS questions are popular fodder for
technical interviews.</strong> You may be asked to define a particular record type or
to walk through a rough outline of what happens when you type a URL into your
browser and click &quot;Go&quot;. Try thinking through this process with your new
knowledge!</p>
<p>After reading this lesson, you should have a better understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the history and intent of DNS,</li>
<li>how to read &amp; break down a domain name,</li>
<li>and what's involved in translating domains into IP addresses.</li>

<p>We've discussed a lot of data- and internal-communication protocols, but what
supports these? Let's examine some of the most important hardware you'll see
while examining computer networks!</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>networking hardware devices and how they differ,</li>
<li>use cases for each type of device,</li>
<li>and specialized cases with integrated devices</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="three-levels-of-control"></a><h2 id="three-levels-of-control-4">Three levels of control</h2>
<p>Network protocols mean very little if we don't have a physical way of connecting
computers together! Whether it's via copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless
networks, we need ways of managing communications to put those protocols into
action. A quick search for &quot;networking hardware&quot; will yield a slew of results,
but don't get overwhelmed! We can boil many of these devices down to three
types: <u>hubs</u>, <u>switches</u>, and <u>routers</u>.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="hubs%3A-keeping-it-simple"></a><h3 id="hubs-keeping-it-simple-4">Hubs: keeping it simple</h3>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-networking-hub.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>A <u>hub</u> is the simplest networking device you're likely to find in service. It
performs no network management and might be better known as a &quot;signal splitter&quot;.
When a hub receives data, it duplicates that data and broadcasts it to all
connected devices. That's it!</p>
<p>Hubs tend to be cheap and are often found in older networks. They are usually
small metal boxes with a handful of physical connectors. You can get hubs with
lots of connectors, but they're usually a little smaller - think 5 or 10 instead
of 30 or 40. This is due to the natural limitations a hub possesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heads up! We'll refer to the physical sockets that cables plug into as
<u>connectors</u>, but you'll often hear them called <u>ports</u> instead. This can get
<strong>very</strong> confusing, so be sure you're clear about the difference between
virtual ports used by transport protocols and physical ports used by hardware.
When in doubt, use a clearer term, like &quot;connector&quot; or &quot;jack&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For one, a hub can't do any sort of filtering. This means every single data
packet is sent to every single device, all the time. This creates a lot of
unnecessary load on the network. Imagine if every time you called a friend, all
of your other friends' phones rang too. Yikes! Additionally, hubs share
bandwidth across devices, so heavy traffic can result in lower speeds. We'll
sometimes see this problem on overloaded networks with other devices, but on a
hub it's guaranteed.</p>
<p>Hubs were a helpful and necessary piece of hardware for a long time, but today
there's little reason to use them. They may still be slightly cheaper than a
switch, but the limitations outweigh most cost concerns. The best use for a hub
now is as a temporary replacement while replacing a broken device.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="switches%3A-traffic-control"></a><h3 id="switches-traffic-control-4">Switches: traffic control</h3>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-networking-switch.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>A step up from the hub, we find a network <u>switch</u>. Switches are &quot;intelligent&quot;
hubs: they track devices connected to them, help manage network load, and can
manage separate internal networks with ease! The biggest thing that separates a
switch from a hub is the <u>MAC address table</u>.</p>
<p>A network switch maintains an internal address book containing the MAC addresses
of the devices connected to it. Remember that data frames contain both a source
and destination MAC address? This is how the switch stays up to date! It uses
this data to perform one of three actions with each piece of data it receives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>flood</u>: When a destination address is unknown, the switch will <u>flood</u>
received data out to all connected devices <strong>except where the data came
from</strong>. When the intended recipient responds, the switch will update its MAC
address table accordingly. This is how switches learn about connected devices,
and it's significantly more efficient than a hub's behavior of flooding all
the time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>forward</u>: When a switch already has the destination MAC address in its
internal table, it can send data directly to that device. This is called
<u>forwarding</u> the data. No other devices connected to the switch are made aware
of this data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>filter</u>: Sometimes a switch will receive data on the same connector the data
is destined for. In these cases, the switch will <u>filter</u>, or drop, the data
entirely. This can be a little confusing to think about! If data arrives on
the same connector it would later be sent out of, then we can assume the data
was handled by some other part of our network, and the receiving switch can't
do anything to help. Remember that this is very specifically related to the
physical connector the data is received on: a switch will never act on data
that comes in and goes out the same connector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Switches often look just like hubs, but come in a much larger range of sizes.
They can be chained together to cover large networks, or a 5-connector switch
might be used for a small home network. Switches have improved on hubs'
limitations: they don't share bandwidth, so you'll see less impact on speed
through a switch than you might through a hub.</p>
<p>If you're building a home or single-location office network today, switches are
your friend. They provide lots of simple management functionality for not much
cash, and they're easy to keep around.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="routers%3A-thinking-globally"></a><h3 id="routers-thinking-globally-4">Routers: thinking globally</h3>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-networking-router.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>Here's a thought experiment: let's think about what a switch for a national
network might look like. Since switches can be chained together, we wouldn't
need thousands of connectors - but we would need <u>lots</u> of memory! The MAC
address table would need to hold entries for every computer in the country. No
way!</p>
<p>Instead of trying to solve this problem with switches, we have a higher-level
device: the <u>router</u>. Routers connect separate networks with each other. Instead
of identifying devices via MAC address, they use IP addresses to make decisions
about data.</p>
<p>A router, like a switch, maintains an internal table of addresses. This <u>routing
table</u> is used to pass received data on through the network. Data may move on to
another router, or the router may recognize the data and pass it to an internal
switch.</p>
<p>Routers also participate in an important process called <u>NAT</u>, short for
<u>Network Address Translation</u>. NAT helps minimize IP address overload by giving
the router a single IP address to use for all external communication. The router
then uses IP ports to map incoming data to internal device IP addresses in its
routing table. Imagine living in an apartment complex with a mail office. The
postal service could bring packages with your apartment number to the front
desk, and the mail officer would dole those packages out, but the sender would
never actually have to know your name or exactly where your apartment is
located! NAT provides a tiny bit of security and allows significantly more
computers to coexist on the Internet simultaneously.</p>
<p>Because of the extra processing power required to handle large routing tables &amp;
filtering, routers tend to cost substantially more than switches. However, most
networks only need one router! We sometimes describe routers as being our
<u>gateway</u> to the Internet.</p>
<p>Physically, routers come in all shapes and sizes. They only need two connectors
(one incoming, one outgoing), but they often come as part of an integrated
device with multiple connectors and functions.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="a-practical-example-of-network-hardware"></a><h2 id="a-practical-example-of-network-hardware-4">A practical example of network hardware</h2>
<p>That's enough theory! Let's think through a practical example of each of the
pieces of network hardware we've discussed.</p>
<p>Imagine you need to get a message to a friend across the room. There are lots of
people between you and your friend: how might you communicate?</p>
<p>One way might be to shout. If you shout your message to the room, the rest of
the people in the room could repeat it to make sure it's heard! This is going to
result in some ringing ears, but your friend will definitely hear the message.
This is how <u>hubs</u> work: broadcast to everyone, no matter who's listening.</p>
<p>An alternative might be to whisper. You could pass a message to the person right
next to you. Of course, they won't know everyone in the room, so they'll have to
ask the people close to them to pass it along. It may take a bit to get to your
friend the first time, but any responses will be lightning-fast since everyone
now knows who to talk to. This is a <u>switched</u> model: <u>flood</u> the message once
to learn how to get to the destination, then use what we've learned to <u>forward</u>
&amp; <u>filter</u> appropriately.</p>
<p>Finally, imagine your friend has left the room. Uh oh! We could still use the
shouting or whispering approach, but none of that matters since we now need to
find the correct room your friend is in. To do this, we'd need people familiar
with each room. We could pass our message to those gatekeepers, who could pass
the message for us from room to room until it reaches the correct one. At that
point, the process will reverse in the new room: the gatekeeper will whisper or
shout, the room will respond accordingly, and responses will come back via the
gatekeepers. The gatekeepers are acting as our <u>routers</u> here: they pass our
messages between rooms, but don't necessarily care how the room communicates
internally.</p>
<p>Notice in this example that each type of communication has a purpose, and all of
them work together. We're simplifying things, but it's easy to concoct an
example where we need all three types, or where we only need one. This is true
of hardware was well. You should choose the correct devices for the network
you're building. Not thinking through your needs may result in a steep cost,
both in terms of performance and in terms of money!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="integrated-devices"></a><h2 id="integrated-devices-4">Integrated devices</h2>
<p>It's easiest to think of these three classes of hardware as separate, distinct
devices. However, this won't always be the case. Let's discuss some situations
where these devices exist in unfamiliar packages.</p>
<p>When you set up Internet at a new home, you usually get a modem from your ISP.
Years ago, this modem was dead simple: one inbound connection for your phone
line or cable, and one outbound connection for your home PC. Today, however, our
homes have multiple devices! Consumers became increasingly frustrated with
getting a modem from one company but still needing a router and/or switch to
connect all their computers.</p>
<p>In response, ISPs upped their game by integrating extra devices in their
&quot;modems&quot;. The average home gateway today includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a modem to translate the physical signal from the cable/phone line,</li>
<li>a router to manage your internal and external IP addresses,</li>
<li>a wireless antenna for wi-fi connections,</li>
<li>and a 5-connector switch for wired connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Woah! That's a lot of hardware in one device. This behavior has blurred the
lines between types of hardware and made communication about networked devices
more difficult. Your ISP might call that single device a &quot;modem&quot;, a &quot;router&quot;, a
&quot;gateway&quot;, or an &quot;access point&quot;. All of these are true!</p>
<p>Before making decisions about a network you're investigating, make sure you
understand what each device is doing. Does that router include a switch? Is the
modem a simple modem or does it include a hub as well? As always, make sure
you're using the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>There are lots of different types of network hardware out there, but most of
them fall into three separate categories. Hopefully, the next time you see
inside a messy server closet, you'll be curious about which parts you can
identify!</p>
<p>After this reading, you should be comfortable with:</p>
<ul>

<p>The <u>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</u> is the backbone of the Internet. The
majority of services we use rely on it, and a deeper understanding of it will
help you navigate those services with ease.</p>
<p>Let's deep-dive into TCP! We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP segments what information they carry,</li>
<li>&quot;control bits&quot; that manage the TCP lifecycle,</li>
<li>and the process of forming &amp; discarding connections.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="segments"></a><h2 id="segments-4">Segments</h2>
<p>Just like the <u>Internet Protocol (IP)</u> uses <u>packets</u>, TCP uses data units
called <u>segments</u>. Segments are formed from application data: TCP receives this
data, breaks it down into transmittable units, and attaches a <u>header</u> to each
unit. This header contains everything we need to ensure a reliable connection is
established.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="segment-header-fields"></a><h3 id="segment-header-fields-4">Segment Header Fields</h3>
<p>As with IP, TCP header fields are critical to understand. They help satisfy two
needs of the protocol: <strong>reliable data transfer</strong> and <strong>consistent
connections</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of each field in the order they appear:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-header-fields.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Source / Destination Port:</strong> The first two fields indicate which port the
request originated on and which port it's directed to. This will be used,
along with the IP address in the IP wrapper containing the segment, to
determine which <u>sockets</u> to use for the TCP connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sequence Number:</strong> This number is used to establish the correct ordering of
data. At the start of a connection, TCP sets an <u>Initial Sequence Number
(ISN)</u> that's sufficiently large enough to avoid conflicts. Each byte of data
transferred is then counted, beginning at the ISN, and used to calculate the
sequence number for the segment. Sequence numbers go hand-in-hand with the ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement Number:</strong> This number lets the sender know which sequence is
expected next. Acknowledgement numbers are cumulative, which is how TCP
maintains proper ordering of segments. The receiver will send an
acknowledgement number that's one higher than the last sequence number plus
the length of the last data received. For example: if the last sequence number
received was <code>10</code>, and the accompanying data was 4 bits long, the response
will include an acknowledgement number of <code>15</code> - meaning &quot;I'm ready for
sequence number 15!&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Offset:</strong> Defines how long the segment header is. This lets us know if
there are options later on in the header or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reserved:</strong> A short range of three bits, held over for later use. These will
always be <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Flags:</strong> These nine bits drive the TCP connection process. We'll
break them down in more detail soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Window Size:</strong> This field is used to let the sender know how much data the
receiver can accept. This helps maintain the reliability of a connection: if a
receiver is getting overloaded, they can lower the window size as a way of
saying &quot;slow down!&quot;. If a slow connection can move faster, a larger window
size is a way of saying &quot;bring it on!&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checksum:</strong> The <u>checksum</u> is an error-checking mechanism. Checksums are
used to check the validity of a particular segment, not the whole series of
segment (as with sequence/acknowledgement). The TCP client can use the
checksum to ensure the segment has been received correctly. If it doesn't
match expectations, the segment will be discarded &amp; ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urgent Pointer:</strong> TCP allows for data to be marked as <u>urgent</u>. This means
it should be processed right away, regardless of sequence, interrupting any
other transfer in process. This is useful when trying to terminate a long
transfer, as we'd like to kill the connection without waiting for it to
complete. This field indicates how much urgent data to expect, if there is
any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Like most other protocols, the TCP segment header includes a
range for <u>options</u> at its end. There may be no options, or there may be a
handful! We can verify whether there are options be comparing the length of
the header so far to the <u>data offset</u> field. TCP header options are mostly
used for flow control and may even include <u>padding</u> to fill out the expected
length of the header with empty data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately after any options (or after the <u>urgent pointer</u>, if no options are
given), the encapsulated data from our application begins.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="tcp-connection-lifecycle"></a><h2 id="tcp-connection-lifecycle-4">TCP Connection Lifecycle</h2>
<p>Remember that TCP is a <u>connection-oriented protocol</u>. This means that it
establishes a long-running line of communication between two points, instead of
just shouting into the Internet void like UDP. Establishing this connection
involves a series of predictable steps, each with specific names. Most of these
steps are driven by the <u>control flags</u> in the segment headers.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="control-flag-options"></a><h3 id="control-flag-options-4">Control Flag Options</h3>
<p>The segment header has 12 bits reserved for control flags. The first three of
these are currently unused and will always be zero, and the next three are all
used by congestion-management extensions to the protocol. The control flags that
most concern us are the final six bits, each known by a short three-letter name.
Let's review them in order:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-header-control-flags.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>URG:</strong> The &quot;<strong>urg</strong>ent&quot; bit. Lets us know if this segment contains urgent
data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACK:</strong> The &quot;<strong>ack</strong>nowledgement&quot; bit. Setting this bit means a message has
been received successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PSH:</strong> The &quot;<strong>p</strong>u<strong>sh</strong>&quot; bit. This bit is used to indicate that buffered
data should be passed on to the connected application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RST:</strong> The &quot;<strong>r</strong>e<strong>s</strong>e<strong>t</strong>&quot; bit. This bit means we should reset the
connection. Receivers will send an RST segment when they receive unexpected
data, either to a port that's not listening or dramatically out-of-sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SYN:</strong> The &quot;<strong>syn</strong>chronize&quot; bit. This flag is set on the the first segment
from each side of the connection, and should include an ISN for the socket to
begin sequencing from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FIN:</strong> The &quot;<strong>fin</strong>ished&quot; bit. This bit lets each side know that
transmission is done and the connection may be closed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we mention all twelve bits here as &quot;control bits&quot; even though the
first three are unassigned. While they are currently unused, protocols evolve
frequently! The <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">TCP specification</a> lists &quot;six reserved bits, six control
bits&quot;, but newer specs have claimed some of those. For this reason, you should
think of the remaining three reserved bits as &quot;control flags still under
development&quot;.</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="getting-to-know-each-other%3A-the-three-way-handshake"></a><h3 id="getting-to-know-each-other-the-three-way-handshake-4">Getting to know each other: the three-way handshake</h3>
<p>TCP connections begin with a process called a <u>three-way-handshake</u>, also
sometimes referred to as <u>SYN-SYN-ACK</u>.  This name comes from the three
interactions before the connection is officially &quot;open&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client notifies the server that data is incoming with a <code>SYN</code> segment.</li>
<li>The server acknowledges that data and sends its own segment, including both an
<code>ACK</code> and its own <code>SYN</code>.</li>
<li>The client <code>ACK</code>nowledges with another segment to the server. Now both sides
are ready to go!</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that we can send both a <code>SYN</code> and <code>ACK</code> on a single segment. This is
called <u>piggybacking</u> and saves us a ton of requests! The three-way handshake
would become a four-way handshake if we had to send the <code>SYN</code> and <code>ACK</code>
separately.</p>
<p>TCP connections are often visualized using <u>ladder diagrams</u>, also sometimes
called <u>timing diagrams</u>. Let's take a look at one for the three-way handshake:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-three-way-opening.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>This diagram should be read top-to-bottom. Each arrow represents a single
segment being passed between hosts. You can see how the client initiates the
request, but the server mirrors the process. This ensures both sides are ready
to work: if the client's <code>SYN</code> request fell on deaf ears, we would expect an
<code>RST</code> segment back.</p>
<p>You can also see how the <u>sequence number</u> and <u>acknowledgement number</u> are
incremented for each segment. Since these initial segments contain no data, each
only increments by one. During data transfer, the numbers will increment based
on the length of data received so far.</p>
<p>TCP maintains timers for most behaviors to ensure that connections don't hang
empty forever. This is one reason time-based diagrams are so helpful: by
adjusting the angle of the arrows between the client &amp; server, we can indicate a
faster or slower connection. This can be helpful for visualizing connections on
a granular level. For example, here's a simplified diagram of the same three-way
handshake with a slow server response:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-slow-connection.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="data-transmission-%26-error-handling"></a><h3 id="data-transmission--error-handling-4">Data transmission &amp; error handling</h3>
<p>Once the connection has been <u>established</u>, we're off to the races! The client
will send data segments over and the server will respond with <code>ACK</code> segments.</p>
<p>Remember that the sequence number in each data segment indicates where our data
starts, and the corresponding acknowledgement number should be the next position
after our data ends. For example, a data segment with a sequence number of <code>4</code>
and data of length <code>3</code> will be <code>ACK</code>'ed with an acknowledgement number of <code>7</code>:
our data included <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> in the sequence, and the server is letting
us know that it's ready for data beginning at sequence number <code>7</code>.</p>
<p>Here's a fun way of visualizing this concept via text messages between the
client &amp; server:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-seq-ack.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>Note that there
won't be any more <code>SYN</code> segments unless the connection terminates unexpectedly:
we only send segments with the <code>SYN</code> flag enabled when initializing a
connection.</p>
<p>The acknowledgement number is important for keeping the TCP connection reliable.
It will only increment when a segment is successfully received, so an <code>ACK</code>
response to the client with a lower acknowledgement number than the client's
current sequence number means a segment was missed and must be retransmitted.</p>
<p>A diagram is worth a thousand words:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-dropped-segment.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>This is a <strong>major</strong> part of TCP, and one of the reasons it's both reliable and
slow: data may need to be retransmitted frequently, but the end result is always
a full &amp; correct payload on the server.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="saying-goodbye%3A-closing-the-connection"></a><h3 id="saying-goodbye-closing-the-connection-4">Saying goodbye: closing the connection</h3>
<p>Once we've sent all our data across the wire, it's time to say <u>au revoir</u>. By
default, TCP closes open connections similarly to the way they're opened: lots
of handshakery! By default, this time it's a <u>four-way handshake</u>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a diagram of a TCP connection closing:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-four-way-closing.svg" style="width: 100%; height:
  auto;">
</p>
<p>This diagram is similar to the three-way handshake we looked at for connection
establishment, so it may raise a question for you: why the extra handshake? The
reason, as usual, is <u>reliability</u>!</p>
<p>Remember how TCP maintains timers between segments.? This is because no matter
how much reliability we've worked into transport protocols, they're still built
on top of unreliable protocols and infrastructure. The same is true of a closing
connection: we don't want to act too quickly or we may miss a piece of extra
important data.</p>
<p>When closing a connection, both sides wait a beat before actually closing. This
allows any delayed segments to slip in at the last minute! This also means it is
impractical for the server to send a piggybacked <code>FIN</code> &amp; <code>ACK</code> in the same way
it sends a <code>SYN</code> &amp; <code>ACK</code> to open the connection. If the server waited before
sending an <code>ACK</code>, the client may think something went wrong and begin
retransmitting. To prevent this, the server responses are separated:</p>
<ul>
<li>the server returns an <code>ACK</code> to the client's first <code>FIN</code> right away,</li>
<li>it waits a moment to ensure there are no remaining data segments inbound,</li>
<li>and then it sends a corresponding <code>FIN</code> segment to let the client know it's
shutting down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client will <code>ACK</code>nowledge immediately, but may also wait a bit before truly
closing, just in case. With all the handshaking and waiting around, you might
call TCP a &quot;considerate&quot; protocol as well!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-tcp-socket-state-lifecycle"></a><h3 id="the-tcp-socket-state-lifecycle-4">The TCP Socket State Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Remember that a TCP connection is between two <u>sockets</u>, or joint IP
address/port pairs. As the connection progresses, these sockets change <u>state</u>.
For example, during the process of data transfer, both sockets are considered to
be in the <code>ESTABLISHED</code> state, while before a connection is established a
server's open socket would be in the <code>LISTEN</code> state.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that this flow isn't identical for the client &amp;
server, too: after the client sends its <code>SYN</code>, it enters a <code>SYN SENT</code> state
while the server enters a <code>SYN RCVD</code> (or &quot;<code>SYN</code> Received&quot;) state of its own.</p>
<p>Here's a diagram of a simple data transfer from start to finish. Notice that
we've added the socket states for each side of the connection outside the
diagram. These may be noted by network tools and can be helpful to reference if
you find yourself debugging a TCP connection problem:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-ip-tcp-socket-states.svg" style="width: 100%; height:

</p>
<p>The original TCP specification includes an <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">alternative text-based chart</a> for
the lifecycle of these socket states, and you can read more about this process
on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Address_representation">Wikipedia page</a> for TCP.</p>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="following-the-trail-with-%60traceroute%60"></a><h1 id="following-the-trail-with-traceroute-4">Following The Trail With <code>traceroute</code></h1>
<p>Remember that the Internet is a &quot;network of networks&quot;<a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">1</a>. This can make it tough
to <u>debug</u> problems between networks: how do we identify the culprit? Enter
<u>traceroute</u>! Let's explore this utility and learn how to find problems with
inter-network connections.</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <code>traceroute</code> is and when to use it,</li>
<li>how to read <code>traceroute</code> output,</li>
<li>and how to use <code>traceroute</code> to solve problems.</li>
</ul>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="where-are-we-going%3F"></a><h2 id="where-are-we-going-4">Where are we going?</h2>
<p>When we create connections between networks, they're rarely direct. We've
already discussed how the IP protocol works to connect devices across multiple
intermediaries. While the theory and addressing makes sense, it raises a new
challenge: how do we solve problems when we can't get access to the other
networks involved?</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's a utility that lets us peek at devices along the way. It's
called <code>traceroute</code>. The <code>traceroute</code> utility runs on the command line and uses
UDP packets to monitor each device that data passes through as it moves from the
source location to the target location. Using this utility, we can determine
where a network failure or slowdown might be occurring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>traceroute</code> vs. <code>tracert</code></p>
<p>If you do some research of your own, you may find <code>traceroute</code> referred to as
<code>tracert</code>. These utilities  work slightly differently. <code>tracert</code> is included
with the Windows operating system, and uses <u>ICMP</u> (an alternative protocol
also used by the <code>ping</code> utility) to trace data. <code>traceroute</code> is on Unix-based
operating systems, including macOS, and uses UDP. We'll prefer <code>traceroute</code>
here, but the output of both utilities is almost identical! If you find
yourself investigating network problems on a Windows computer, the skills
covered here will translate seamlessly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll sometimes hear using <code>traceroute</code> referred to as &quot;running a trace&quot;.
Running a trace of your own is easy - enter the following on your command line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"><div>&gt; traceroute appacademy.io
</div></code></pre>
<p>Boom! Your first trace! So what does all that gibberish mean? Let's break it
down.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="reading-a-trace"></a><h2 id="reading-a-trace-4">Reading a trace</h2>
<p>Here's a screenshot of <code>traceroute appacademy.io</code> from my terminal:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-tools-traceroute-screenshot.svg" style="width:
  auto;">
</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="metadata"></a><h3 id="metadata-9">Metadata</h3>
<p>First, let's look at the overall breakdown. At the top of the trace, you'll see
some general info. There's a warning about &quot;multiple addresses&quot;, meaning that
<code>appacademy.io</code> resolves to more than one IP address. This is common for popular
websites that use multiple servers to reduce traffic and keep speeds high. Next,
you'll see the true beginning of the trace, including the domain we're tracing
to, the IP address it resolved to, and a maximum number of <u>hops</u> (&quot;64&quot;) and
<u>packet size</u> &quot;(52 byte&quot;).</p>
<p>We mentioned <u>hops</u> when discussing networking protocols, but here's a quick
review: a &quot;hop&quot; is one connection to another server. Think of the houses on your
street or apartments on your hall. A single hop would walking to your next door
neighbor's home. Three hops would be walking three doors down. When we run
<code>traceroute</code>, it tracks the location of each hop, but it limits the number of
hops to make sure we're not searching for an unavailable address forever! Our
<code>traceroute</code> won't go more than 64 hops, though this default may differ across
systems.</p>
<p>Below the general info, we see a numbered list of addresses. Each line
represents one hop, and includes some important info about that destination.
Let's check it out!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="the-hop"></a><h3 id="the-hop-4">The Hop</h3>
<p>Here's our first hop:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-tools-traceroute-single-hop-screenshot.svg"
  style="width: auto;">
</p>
<p>We know it's the first because of the <code>1</code> on the left side. Each hop is preceded
by a number indicating how many hops it took to get there.</p>
<p>Next, we see two IP addresses. These identify the network location our trace has
reached. In this case, the location has no resolvable DNS name so we just see
the IP address. If you look ahead a bit, you can see that addresses with a
resolvable name will show that name first instead.</p>
<p>Finally, we see three numbers. These are time intervals, (indicated by the &quot;ms&quot;,
short for &quot;milliseconds&quot;) that let us know how long it took us to reach this
location from our system. When we run a trace, <code>traceroute</code> attempts each hop
three times. This is because UDP (and the Internet beneath it!) is inherently
unreliable. Testing the hop three times ensures we get truly representative data
and not a false reading due to a dropped packet or network congestion. Each of
the three numbers we see is the response time from one of those attempts.
They'll always vary slightly, but we can get a good idea of the average response
time. In this case, the numbers are <strong>very</strong> small: two tenths of a millisecond!
Wow!.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This first hop is my home internet router! We can tell this not only because
it's the first device reached beyond my own computer, but also because the IP
address is within one of IPv4's <u>reserved ranges</u>, meant for private networks
inside homes and businesses. It's unlikely you'll see reserved addresses
outside of your current network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hops proceed from our own device to the <u>gateway</u> for the device we're trying to
reach. We can analyze each hop using the same breakdown.</p>
<p>The first hop in our trace is straightforward, but that's not always the case!
Let's take a look at a few not-so-standard situations you may see come up.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="special-cases"></a><h3 id="special-cases-4">Special cases</h3>
<p>Notice that our second hop doesn't have any of the info we expect from
<code>traceroute</code>. Instead, it has three asterisks:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-tools-traceroute-empty-hop-screenshot.svg"
  style="width: auto;">
</p>
<p>In <code>traceroute</code>-speak, an asterisk (<code>*</code>) represents a hop with no response. This
doesn't necessarily mean the hop failed, just that our system didn't get a
response back! This could be due to server configuration or a slow connection.
By default, a hop will return a <code>*</code> if there's no response for five seconds.
There are three asterisks in this case to indicate that all three attempts went
unanswered.</p>
<p>Let's also take a look at our eighth hop:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/image-network-tools-traceroute-load-balanced-hop-screenshot.svg"
  style="width: auto;">
</p>
<p>This one entry has multiple addresses! What's going on? This is an example of
<u>load balancing</u> in action. In this case, the router at our seventh hop is
directing traffic to multiple locations. This <u>balances</u> the <u>load</u> and ensures
that one single router isn't handling too much.</p>
<p>In this case, one of our hop attempts went to the <code>atln.ga</code> (Atlanta, Georgia)
router, while the other two went to the <code>snjs.ca</code> (San Jose, California) router.
We still see timestamps for all three hop attempts.</p>
<p>Because of load balancing, your connection to <code>appacademy.io</code> isn't guaranteed
to be the same each time. Try running <code>traceroute appacademy.io</code> again - do you
see the exact same addresses as before?</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="when-should-i-run-a-trace%3F"></a><h2 id="when-should-i-run-a-trace-4">When should I run a trace?</h2>
<p>Tracing is most useful for diagnosing network connectivity issues. Imagine your
internet at home suddenly goes down! You can <code>traceroute</code> to a familiar domain
to see if the connection fails before it gets to your own router (in which case,
it's likely a problem on your device), or it fails at a network outside yours.</p>
<p>You can also diagnose slow connections this way! If a hop has a very long
response time (&gt; 50 ms), then it's possible that a previous device in line is
experiencing downtime or network congestion.</p>
<p><code>traceroute</code> is simple to use without them, but does include some command line
arguments that can enhance its abilities. Check out <code>man traceroute</code> to learn
more about what it can do!</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="what-we've-learned"></a><h2 id="what-weve-learned-39">What we've learned</h2>
<p>When in doubt, <code>trace-</code> the <code>-route</code>! Tracing network traffic using the

own network.</p>
<p>After this lesson, you should be comfortable:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>traceroute</code> to diagnose connection problems,</li>
<li>reading the output of a <code>traceroute</code> command,</li>

<a for="toc-anchor" id="capturing-packets"></a><h2 id="capturing-packets-4">Capturing packets</h2>
<p>After downloading and installing Wireshark, you can launch it and double-click
the name of a network interface under Capture to start capturing packets on that
interface. For example, if you want to capture traffic on your wireless network,
click your wireless interface. You can configure advanced features by clicking
Capture &gt; Options, but this isn't necessary for now.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As soon as you click the interface's name, you'll see the packets start to
appear in real time. Wireshark captures each packet sent to or from your system.</p>
<p>If you have promiscuous mode enabled—it's enabled by default—you'll also see all
the other packets on the network instead of only packets addressed to your
network adapter. To check if promiscuous mode is enabled, click Capture &gt;
Options and verify the &quot;Enable promiscuous mode on all interfaces&quot; checkbox is
activated at the bottom of this window.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the red &quot;Stop&quot; button near the top left corner of the window when you want
to stop capturing traffic.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The packet list pane, located at the top of the window, shows all packets found
in the active capture file. Each packet has its own row and corresponding number
assigned to it, along with each of these data points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No</strong>: This field indicates which packets are part of the same conversation.
It remains blank until you select a packet.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: The timestamp of when the packet was captured is displayed in this
column. The default format is the number of seconds or partial seconds since
this specific capture file was first created.</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: This column contains the address (IP or other) where the packet
originated.</li>
<li><strong>Destination</strong>: This column contains the address that the packet is being
sent to.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: The packet's protocol name, such as TCP, can be found in this
column.</li>
<li><strong>Length</strong>: The packet length, in bytes, is displayed in this column.</li>
<li><strong>Info</strong>: Additional details about the packet are presented here. The contents
of this column can vary greatly depending on packet contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a packet is selected in the top pane, you may notice one or more symbols
appear in the No. column. Open or closed brackets and a straight horizontal
line indicate whether a packet or group of packets are part of the same
back-and-forth conversation on the network. A broken horizontal line signifies
that a packet is not part of the conversation.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="color-coding"></a><h2 id="color-coding-4">Color coding</h2>
<p>You'll probably see packets highlighted in a variety of different colors.
Wireshark uses colors to help you identify the types of traffic at a glance. By
default, light purple is TCP traffic, light blue is UDP traffic, and black
identifies packets with errors—for example, they could have been delivered out
of order.</p>
<p>To view exactly what the color codes mean, click View &gt; Coloring Rules. You can
also customize and modify the coloring rules from here, if you like.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="sample-captures"></a><h2 id="sample-captures-4">Sample captures</h2>
<p>If there's nothing interesting on your own network to inspect, Wireshark's wiki
has you covered. The wiki contains a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures">page of sample capture</a> files that you can
load and inspect. Click File &gt; Open in Wireshark and browse for your downloaded
file to open one.</p>
<p>Download, open, and inspect each of these capture files so you can see what it
looks like for that communication to have occurred over a network.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=http.cap">http.cap</a> A simple HTTP request and response</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=dns.cap">dns.cap</a> Various DNS lookups</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=wpa-Induction.pcap">wpa.cap</a> 802.11 capture with WPA data encrypted using the password &quot;Induction&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also save your own captures in Wireshark and open them later. Click the
File &gt; Save to save your captured packets.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="filtering-packets"></a><h2 id="filtering-packets-4">Filtering packets</h2>
<p>If you're trying to inspect something specific, such as the traffic a program
sends when phoning home, it helps to close down all other applications using the
network so you can narrow down the traffic. Still, you'll likely have a large
amount of packets to sift through. That's where Wireshark's filters come in.</p>
<p>The most basic way to apply a filter is by typing it into the filter box at the
top of the window and clicking Apply (or pressing Enter). For example, type
&quot;dns&quot; and you'll see only DNS packets. When you start typing, Wireshark will
help you autocomplete your filter.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-04.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also click Analyze &gt; Display Filters to choose a filter from among the
default filters included in Wireshark. From here, you can add your own custom
filters and save them to easily access them in the future.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing you can do is right-click a packet and select Follow &gt;
TCP Stream.</p>
<p>You'll see the full TCP conversation between the client and the server. You can
also click other protocols in the Follow menu to see the full conversations for
other protocols, if applicable.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="inspecting-packets"></a><h2 id="inspecting-packets-4">Inspecting packets</h2>
<p>Click a packet to select it and you can dig down to view its details.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-05.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also create filters from here — just right-click one of the details and
use the Apply as Filter submenu to create a filter based on it.</p>
<p><img src="images/wireshark-06.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wireshark is an extremely powerful tool, and this tutorial is just scratching
the surface of what you can do with it. Professionals use it to debug network
protocol implementations, examine security problems and inspect network protocol
internals.</p>
<a for="toc-anchor" id="assignment"></a><h2 id="assignment-4">Assignment</h2>
<p>Now, start Wireshark, start capturing network traffic, and perform various
tasks on your computer using different applications. You will be surprised by
the number of network requests made by your computer. See if you can identify
the application that makes each request and the significance of each request.</p>

<p>There is a lot of terminology and knowledge in today's lessons. These aren't
skills that you can necessarily apply. However, the body of knowledge is
essential to understand how networking works both in ideal and practical senses.</p>
<p>Today, it's up to you to make your own flashcards for studying. You can make
then in your pair and share the Anki files. Use them to study because this will
likely be on your assessment and in some interviews.</p>
